0,Louis Jacobson,“We created more new jobs in two years than any president did in their entire term.”,"President Joe Biden has regularly touted how well job creation is going on his watch, and he did so again at a Democratic National Committee event in Philadelphia just days before his State of the Union address. ""We created more new jobs in two years than any president did in their entire term,"" Biden said  Feb. 3.The statement was an updated version of the message the White House sent in an Instagram post in October. Back then, we found the claim lacked important context. That’s the case again. The most basic way to look at Biden’s comparison is to measure job gains on each president’s watch without making any adjustments for time in office. We used official Labor Department data for every post-World War II president. (Pre-World War II economic data is less consistent.)If you do that, three postwar presidents — Lyndon Johnson, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton — saw a greater raw increase in jobs on their watches than Biden’s 12.1 million so far. Johnson had 12.2 million, Reagan had 16.1 million, and Clinton had 22.9 million.!function(e,i,n,s){var t=""InfogramEmbeds"",d=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(""script"");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,""infogram-async""); However, the White House clarified to PolitiFact that Biden was referring to any single presidential ""term,"" not ""terms."" And Biden did exceed the total in each of Clinton’s terms and easily outpaced every other president on the list. So by that standard, Biden did exceed each of the presidents.However, this comparison requires important context.For starters, the labor force’s size has grown considerably since Dwight Eisenhower was president. A more telling (but still imperfect) measurement is the percentage increase of jobs on a president’s watch.Using this metric, Biden’s showing is in the middle. The percentage increase was more than twice as big under Johnson, Reagan and Clinton than it has been under Biden. He also trails former Presidents Richard Nixon and Barack Obama using this method.!function(e,i,n,s){var t=""InfogramEmbeds"",d=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(""script"");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,""infogram-async""); Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 12, 2023 in a photo on FacebookThe cost of eggs has gone up 700%.By Sara Swann • January 13, 2023Another problem is that these presidents served varying terms: Some served eight years, some served four, others served partial terms, and Biden himself has only served two years so far.The most basic way of correcting for these variations is to determine the jobs gained per year in office. This metric is a strong one for Biden: His job growth per year is roughly double that of any other president’s.!function(e,i,n,s){var t=""InfogramEmbeds"",d=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(""script"");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,""infogram-async""); This requires an important caveat.The longer presidents serve in office, the likelier it is they will encounter an economic downturn. And the job losses during economic downturns are what hamper the job-creation averages for presidents. The elder Bush experienced one in the middle of his term, the younger Bush faced one at both the start and the end of his presidency, Obama entered office with the Great Recession raging, and Trump was in office when the coronavirus pandemic hit, which created a steep, if short-lived, recession. Only Clinton was lucky enough to avoid a recession. Biden has been fortunate: His strong monthly job-creation averages reflect the economic cycle when he entered office. He was inaugurated in January 2021, as the nation was recovering from the steep and sudden job losses stemming from the pandemic’s onset in 2020. The jobs recovery began under Trump, but because he was out of office only eight months into the recovery, much of the job gains accrued during Biden’s time in the White House.Finally, it’s important to remember that although presidential job creation powers are real, they’re not unlimited. Presidential policy can affect the economy, such as improvement in the fight against the coronavirus partly because of Biden’s policies. Still, there are many other factors beyond a president’s control that can have an effect, including the health of the global economy and improvements in technology.Our rulingBiden said, ""We created more new jobs in two years than any president did in their entire term.""In raw numbers, Biden did oversee greater job growth than any post-World War II president’s first term in office (but not their entire tenure in office, if they served more than one term).But this achievement needs asterisks. Measured by percentage increase from the time the presidents took office, Biden rates in the middle of the pack. And Biden has easily outpaced every postwar president in job gains per year. However, Biden benefited by taking office on the upswing of a deep recession and has not faced a recession yet, something most of his predecessors experienced during their longer terms.We rate the statement Half True.",Joe Biden,"February 7, 2023",half-true
1,D.L. Davis,"""During my time in office, we've increased per pupil aid by more than $300 per student. Now, our schools have returned to the top 10 in the country after falling to 17 under the previous administration.”","Does school aid make a difference in student performance? Gov. Tony Evers thinks so.Evers, who was sworn in Jan. 3 has vowed to seek more public school funding in his upcoming budget. In the days before the start of his second term, Evers touted an increase in aid as well as Wisconsin’s showing on a listing of Best States for Education in the country.""During my time in office, we've increased per pupil aid by more than $300 per student. Now, our schools have returned to the top 10 in the country after falling to 17 under the previous administration."" Evers said in a Dec. 27 Twitter post.Let’s take a look. Additional per pupil aidWhen asked for backup to the claim, the governor’s staff pointed to his two budgets, which in total directed more than an additional $250 million, or about $312 per pupil, to school districts across the state. Evers’ spokeswoman, Britt Cudaback, offered us this breakdown:In the 2019-21 budget, an increase of about $88 per student — bringing per pupil aid to its highest level ever at $742 per pupil. The 2019-21 budget the governor signed included an increase in special education funding. And through the veto process, he increased per-pupil state categorical aid by nearly $100 million over the two-year period.In the 2021-23 budget, an additional $110 million from CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) funds provided an additional $133.72 in per pupil aid for every Wisconsin school district.  In August 2022, Evers announced a $75 million allocation of American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds for school districts and independent charter schools. That amounted to an additional $91.15 per student. Tally that up, and it amounts to $312.87 more per student.But that is a break from how many would normally think of per-pupil spending, since it is focused on a narrow part of the overall education spending picture. And it leans heavily on the infusion of COVID-related federal aid, which is not a continuing source of revenue. According to the nonpartisan Legislative Reference Bureau, Evers doesn’t appear to be referring to ""all state aid provided to school districts on a per-pupil basis"" but to the per-pupil ""categorical aid"" program.  ""The 2019-21 budget did increase the amount provided to school districts in that program to $742 per-pupil in the 2018-19 school year and for each year thereafter,"" an LRB analyst said in response to PolitiFact Wisconsin query. ""This rate is statutory and will continue indefinitely unless changed by legislation."" But there is a key wrinkle to the other parts of the funding:According to the LRB, the CARES funding was not in the 2021-23 budget act. Likewise, the ARPA funding  was a one-time payment to school districts and independent charter schools. As such, ""the payments are not part of a permanent, statutory program.""So, some of the increased aid Evers has touted will continue indefinitely, while other funds are one-time payments and not permanent. (The $312.87 makes up only part of the average spent per student. According to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau’s January 2023 report, the figure in the 2020-21 school year for per pupil aid was $7,537)Jason Stein, vice president and research director of the Wisconsin Policy Forum, agreed: ""It's one-time, though for some districts the overall COVID-19 aid will stretch over several years."" Cudaback argues the aid should not be considered ""temporary.""""The additional nearly $100 million from the 2019-21 biennial budget due to Gov. Evers’ strategic, line-item veto would’ve been built into the base budget for the succeeding 2021-23 biennium so that is, by definition, an ongoing, state-supported investment, not ‘temporary’"" Cudaback said in an email.Featured Fact-checkMarjorie Taylor Greenestated on February 1, 2023 in a House committee hearingIllinois “received $5.1 billion at an elementary school there that used it for equity and diversity.”By Jeff Cercone • February 3, 2023But that part, handled through the normal budget process, is not in dispute. It’s the COVID-related money that is temporary.On that, Cudaback noted that school districts have extensive time, in some cases several years, to use the COVID related money. But that does not make it permanent. Finally, Cudaback also noted that the COVID-related spending came exclusively at Evers’ direction. But that, too, is really not in dispute.In any case, Stein, of the Public Policy Forum, offered an asterisk here. ""The governor was the principal Wisconsin actor who made (the state-based decisions),"" Stein said. ""That said, the federal relief funds came to Wisconsin because of legislation approved by Congress and Presidents Trump and Biden.""Best states rankingsOn this part of the claim, Evers’ staff pointed us to the Best States list from U.S. News & World Report, which shows how each of the 50 U.S. states ranks in 77 metrics across eight categories. The methodology shows the numbers are drawn from data over several years. In 2018, the last year of Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s administration, Wisconsin landed at No. 18 in the education category. In 2019, under Evers, Wisconsin landed at No. 14. The ranking was not published in 2020, but in 2021 the state landed at No. 8. – that’s the top-10 ranking Evers described.However, Evers glosses over a key point: The education rankings are based 50% on higher education and 50% on pre-K-12. The conservative Badger Institute, formerly the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a nonprofit policy research organization, seized on the fact that higher education is part of the ranking equation. ""Team Evers is hyper focused on equating more state spending with better K-12 results,"" said Jim Bender, government affairs consultant for the group. ""Their example does not support that claim.""Bender has a point. Consider the numbers from 2017, under Walker, and 2021, under Evers, and the biggest jump in rankings came in higher education areas.Higher education: The largest uptick in rankings are in 2-year post-secondary public institution graduation rates from No. 12 in 2017 to No. 7 in 2021. In the overall higher education category, Wisconsin improved from No. 21 in 2017 to No. 15 in 2021.Preschool through high school: Wisconsin’s ""college readiness"" rankings dropped from No. 26 in 2017 to No. 32 in 2021; and its high school graduation ranking fell from No. 3 to No. 8. Wisconsin fared better in the math and reading rankings, with math (grade 8) moving from No. 6  to No. 4. Reading rankings (grade 8) rose from No. 8 to No. 6. So, although Wisconsin’s overall education ranking did jump from No. 18 under Walker to No. 8 under Evers, the underlying rankings were more of a mixed bag.Our rulingEvers said ""During my time in office, we've increased per pupil aid by more than $300 per student. Now, our schools have returned to the top 10 in the country after falling to 17 under the previous administration.""For the first part of the claim, the $300-plus figure is generally accurate, but Evers glosses past the fact that some of the increase is based on one-time COVID aid that he steered toward schools. In the second part of the claim, he cites accurate numbers — at least by one measure — but ignores that the ranking involves a 50-50 mix of performance in higher education and pre-K-12 education. And that some of the improvement in ranking is because of the higher ed side.For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.        window.gciAnalyticsUAID = 'PMJS-TEALIUM-COBRAND';window.gciAnalyticsLoadEvents = false;window.gciAnalytics.view({    'event-type': 'pageview',    'content-type': 'interactives',    'content-ssts-section': 'news',    'content-ssts-subsection': 'news:politics',    'content-ssts-topic': 'news:politics:politifactwisconsin',    'content-ssts-subtopic': ' news:politics:politifactwisconsin'});",Tony Evers,"February 7, 2023",half-true

Ron DeSantis on Twitter.""FACT: Permitless carry does not make you safer. States that allow concealed carry have higher gun homicide rates,"" Newsom tweeted Jan. 30. ""DeSantis' bill would remove: background checks, instruction, training (and) oversight."" Newsom was referring to a bill introduced by state Rep. Chuck Brannan III, R-Macclenny, that would allow people to carry concealed guns in public without a Florida license. DeSantis hasn’t commented publicly on the bill, HB 543, but has said he would sign a bill allowing people to carry firearms in public without a permit. Does HB 543 remove gun background checks, instruction, training and oversight, as Newsom claimed? Because getting a license becomes voluntary under the bill, those requirements would no longer be needed to carry a gun in Florida. But the concealed carry license would remain for those who want it, and background checks on gun purchases from federal dealers would remain in effect.HB 543 makes licensing optional, not a requirementNewsom's tweet gave the impression that HB 543 will no longer require people to pass background checks, receive instruction or training or have oversight if they want to carry a concealed weapon.HB 543 would not eliminate the requirements for obtaining a concealed carry license in Florida. But people would no longer be required to have such a license before entering public spaces with a concealed firearm. A Newsom spokesperson told PolitiFact that the governor was ""referencing the fact that these requirements would become voluntary under this new law.""Under existing Florida law, people who wish to carry concealed weapons in public must obtain a license from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

Private sellers, however, don’t need to run background checks.Gun policy experts have said that making concealed weapon licenses optional could make it easier for people to entirely avoid a background check if they buy from private sellers.DeSantis' office did not answer specific questions about the legislation. Brannan, who introduced HB 543, did not respond to our request for comment. Our rulingNewsom said DeSantis' legislation would ""remove background checks, instruction, training and oversight.""That's misleading. DeSantis has said he would support a bill that allows people to carry firearms in public without a permit. At the time of Newsom’s claim, DeSantis had not publicly commented on HB 543. Under that proposal, people are not required to have a concealed weapon license; obtaining such a license is voluntary. However, if people choose to get a license, they must undergo a background check, prove firearms competency and meet other requirements. The bill does not change the federal requirement that people pass a background check when they buy a weapon from a licensed seller.

3,Samantha Putterman,“Female student-athletes in Florida need to provide their schools with detailed information about their periods.”,"UPDATE 2/9: Public outcry over menstrual questions on athletics forms prompted the Florida High School Athletic Association to call an emergency board meeting on Feb. 9 to consider removing the questions. After listening to public comment, the board of directors voted 14-2 in favor of adopting the physical evaluation form without the questions on menstruation. News about a recent recommendation in Florida that would require student-athletes to share detailed information about their menstrual cycles with their schools has prompted a lot of online chatter, and claims that go a step too far in describing the situation. ""Female student athletes in Florida need to provide their schools with detailed information about their periods,"" read one viral Jan. 25 tweet by Jessica Valenti, an abortion rights activist. ""Despite public outcry, the Florida High School Athletics Association is standing by its decision that girls submit menstruation info to schools: including age of their first period, how many days are typically in between their periods, and the date of their most recent period.""Female student athletes in Florida need to provide their schools with detailed information about their periodshttps://t.co/nFJcrnxSJA— Jessica Valenti (@JessicaValenti) January 26, 2023 An advisory committee of the Florida High School Athletic Association recently recommended that student athletes be required to submit information about their periods to their schools. The questions have been included on athletics forms since the early 2000s, but are marked as optional.The recommendation has not been implemented. The association’s board of directors is scheduled to vote on it during meetings on Feb. 26 and 27 in Gainesville. On the same day the tweet was shared, the association’s sports medicine advisory committee upheld its Jan. 17 recommendation to require female athletes to submit menstrual details when registering to play. A motion to rescind it failed on a 5-5 vote. (A majority vote would have been required for the motion to pass.)Until the board of directors votes in February on the recommendation, submitting menstrual information remains optional in Florida.All Florida student-athletes are required to answer medical questions and get a doctor’s clearance to participate in school-sponsored sports. Required forms for female athletes include questions about their menstrual history, including when they got their first period, how many weeks typically pass between periods, and when they had their last one. Physicians review the forms, which have usually been on paper, and turn them in to school athletic directors. Again, as of now, the questions about menstrual cycles are marked as optional.Featured Fact-checkRon DeSantisstated on January 17, 2023 in a press conference""Almost every study now has said with these new boosters, you're more likely to get infected with the bivalent booster.""By Yacob Reyes • January 20, 2023The Florida High School Athletic Association preparticipation physical evaluation form asks female athletes about their periods. (Samantha Putterman, PolitiFact)  The hubbub over the questions began in fall 2022 when some Florida school districts decided to migrate the form to a digital platform maintained by a third-party company. Parents reached out to The Palm Beach Post and raised privacy concerns about how the state was collecting and digitizing reproductive history. The Post published an investigation in October. Critics were concerned that, following the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, students’ medical information could be used in criminal prosecutions. Others argued that making the questions mandatory was part of the state’s attempt to roll back transgender rights.Ok here's a long thread (with many links!) about Florida student athletes being asked to report their menstrual history.Many national outlets have picked this up, so I want to bring you along on the ~journey~ that has been reporting this story.https://t.co/QXJgfQfR0C— Kati Kokal (@katikokal) February 2, 2023 The Palm Beach Post found that a national form — developed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and used by more than a dozen other states — had more privacy protections than the Florida one. The biggest difference is who has access to the information. The national form explicitly states that the portion about athletes' medical histories — including their menstrual history — should not be given to schools and should instead be kept with their physicians. Florida diverges from this guidance by requiring that all answers be submitted to school officials. Craig Damon, executive director of the state’s high school athletic association, told the Post this allows schools to ""‘provide any necessary medical information’ to a health care worker who is helping a sick or injured student."" The Post investigation found that athletic associations in 40 states and the District of Columbia require student athletes to submit all pages of their forms to their schools. Of those, 34 states include detailed questions about menstrual history. The Post reported that 10 states, including Democratic-leaning California and Republican-leaning North Dakota, specifically instruct athletes not to turn in medical history information to their schools.Some physicians say the information is important and could help identify disorders that put athletes at greater risk for injury, but doctors disagree about with whom it should be shared. Dr. Thresia Gambon, a Miami-Dade pediatrician and president of Florida’s chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, told the Miami Herald that although menstrual history can help doctors evaluate a student athlete’s health, that information, along with other medical questions on the form, should be kept confidential between the student and their health care provider.Our rulingA Twitter post claims that female student athletes in Florida ""need to provide their schools with detailed information about their periods.""This lacks important context. A state committee has recommended that students submit the information, but the proposal has not been voted on or implemented.

This includes encounters recorded by border officers at official ports of entry, and by Border Patrol agents stationed between those ports of entry. Roy's count includes encounters in January 2021, even though Biden was not president for most of that month.Border encounters data represent the number of times officials stopped immigrants, not the number of individual immigrants stopped. If one person tries crossing the border three times, for example, that’s recorded as three encounters.Most border stops led to migrant expulsionsRoy’s claim that most of the immigrants encountered were released into the U.S. isn't accurate, immigration experts told PolitiFact. When immigrants are stopped at the border by Border Patrol, they are either immediately expelled under Title 42, a public health order, or they are apprehended under immigration law.

Others have been given a notice to appear at immigration court at a later date. Officials decide enrollment case by case.Immigration authorities also let in some people under parole, which allows immigrants to stay in the U.S. temporarily. Once in the U.S., parolees can try to adjust their status for lawful permanent residency. Recently, the Biden administration created a parole program for immigrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela to enter the U.S. and work for two years. Because encounters data represent events, not individuals, it’s difficult to know precisely how many people attempted to come into the country.Our rulingRoy tweeted that ""under Biden, we have seen over 4.6 MILLION encounters at our southern border.

The White House did not cite this evidence when we fact-checked a related statement from White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in June.The Pandemic Unemployment Assistance was designed to temporarily expand eligibility for unemployment insurance to self-employed and gig workers during the pandemic. The Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Assistance program temporarily extended assistance by 13 weeks.For unclear reasons, data from these programs isn’t included in the standard unemployment claims data. According to the White House spreadsheet, these two programs pushed the total number of unemployment benefit recipients up to about 18 million in January 2021, as Biden had tweeted. Since both programs have lapsed, the December 2022 figures do not have to be adjusted upward to account for them.Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, a Washington. D.C., think tank, said the White House’s decision to add the two pandemic-era programs to the tally is reasonable. Based on how the programs were structured, there should not be much if any double-counting, he added.Burtless offered a few caveats. He said that some gig workers — people who work as freelancers or contractors — may have qualified for payments for working fewer hours than normal, rather than being entirely unemployed. People in this category would not have met the official definition of being ""unemployed,"" which is how Biden’s tweet characterized them. The long-standing government definition of ""unemployed"" is to be both ""available for work"" and ""actively searching for work."" But it’s hard to tell whether state-run unemployment agencies ""were zealously enforcing"" unemployment rules amid the pandemic’s economic disruptions, Burtless said.Finally, Burtless noted that wider unemployment insurance options were available in January 2021 than in December 2022, given that the pandemic programs have phased out. Therefore, he said, a direct comparison like the one Biden made in his tweet is an apples-and-oranges contrast.Still, Biden’s assertion that today’s unemployment claims are the lowest in decades is on target. Although the most recent month isn’t the lowest ever, a string of recent months have all been at historically low levels.Our rulingBiden tweeted, ""Two years ago this week, 18 million people were out of work needing unemployment benefits. Today, that number is under 1.6 million, the lowest in decades.""The 18 million figure accurately represents the combination of traditional unemployment insurance recipients and those who benefited from temporary programs during the coronavirus pandemic. And Biden’s 1.6 million figure for unemployment claims today is accurate. But Biden’s two snapshots in time aren’t precisely comparable because the pandemic programs have been phased out, effectively offering more lenient opportunities for assistance two years ago than there are today. And some people who received unemployment benefits two years ago, including gig workers who worked fewer hours than they typically would, also didn’t fit the official definition of being unemployed. There’s data supporting Biden’s claim, but his statement leaves out important details and context.

6,Louis Jacobson,"“One quarter” of today’s $31.4 trillion federal debt “was accumulated in the four years of my predecessor,” Donald Trump.","As Democrats and Republicans gird for battle over the nation’s debt limit, President Joe Biden sought to tag his predecessor, Donald Trump, with a significant share of the blame for the nation’s $31.4 trillion federal debt.The U.S. debt has been collecting for over 200 years, and ""one quarter of that debt was accumulated in the four years of my predecessor,"" Biden said during a Jan. 20 event with the U.S. Conference of Mayors. Biden also touted actions on his watch to cut the yearly deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars, setting up a contrast with the debt on Trump's watch.We found that Biden is right on the numbers, but placing the full blame on Trump, as he seemed to do in his remark,is misguided. According to the Treasury Department, when Trump was inaugurated in January 2017, the gross federal debt stood at $19.9 trillion. When Biden took office, it was $27.8 trillion. So, the $7.9 trillion added on Trump’s watch was about 25% the amount of today’s total debt.The White House pointed to Trump’s support for the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced taxes without offsetting spending cuts; the bill passed with only Republican support in Congress. The White House argued that the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that Biden signed into law was designed to reduce deficits.However, experts say the blame game on the federal debt is not clear-cut.A key point that Biden glossed over is that much of the current federal debt stems from mandatory payments, such as those for Social Security and Medicare. These began spiking when the baby boom generation started drawing heavily from these programs around 2010. Not coincidentally, that’s when the federal debt began accelerating.Generations of politicians in both parties approved and modified these programs long before Trump took office.""It is always challenging to figure out how much spending was on whose watch,"" said Steve Ellis, president of the federal budget-watching nonprofit group Taxpayers for Common Sense.Similarly, the biggest single spikes in the federal debt came from the initial rounds of coronavirus relief legislation in 2020. Trump signed them, but they passed with broad bipartisan support.Featured Fact-checkAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezstated on January 27, 2023 in an interview with reporters“The largest contributor to the debt ceiling, or to our deficit, has been the Trump tax cuts.”By Louis Jacobson • February 1, 2023""Everyone, including me, said it was worth it, and without it, things would have been worse,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the center-right American Action Forum. ""So, not fair to blame Trump exclusively for something everyone thought was needed.""Finally, it’s possible to slice the numbers in a way that makes presidential ""blame"" look different.If you look at the raw amount of debt added during a presidency, Barack Obama, who governed with Biden as vice president, ranks first.

7,Louis Jacobson,"“Classified documents can never be taken out of a (sensitive compartmented information facility), ever.”","President Joe Biden has been grappling with the discovery of classified documents at two locations: his post-vice presidential office in Washington, D.C., and his home in Wilmington, Delaware. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to determine whether Biden or his staff have broken any laws governing the handling of classified materials.On ""Fox News Sunday,"" Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., who has served on the House Intelligence Committee, called for equal treatment of Biden’s case and the one involving former President Donald Trump, who is facing his own special counsel investigation of how classified documents and other government papers were stored at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.Referring to Biden’s handling of materials with classified markings, Fitzpatrick cited his experience as an FBI special agent and a federal prosecutor, and said: ""Classified documents can never be taken out of a SCIF, ever."" A SCIF, pronounced ""skiff,"" is intelligence community shorthand for ""sensitive compartmented information facility."" It is a physical space that meets intelligence community protocols in which classified documents can be studied securely by officials with the proper security clearance. We contacted Fitzpatrick’s office to ask for evidence to support his statement, but got no reply. Fitzpatrick made much the same point Aug. 14 on ""Face the Nation,"" after Trump’s documents came to light, saying, ""Nobody's claiming that it's OK to have a, certainly I'm not, that it's okay to have classified information anywhere outside of a SCIF.""Experts, however, told PolitiFact that Fitzpatrick exaggerated and oversimplified the relationship between classified documents and SCIFs. Understanding SCIFsThe federal government and its contractors collectively have thousands of SCIFs in numerous locations, said Robert Deitz, a George Mason University public policy professor who previously worked at the CIA and as the National Security Agency’s general counsel.A SCIF ""is a room — any room — that meets the requirements established by the intel community,"" Deitz said. Those have to do with factors such as locks, isolation and building security, he said.The Office of the Director of National Intelligence distributes a 100-plus-page memo of specifications for the facilities, including criteria for doors and windows and rules for personnel and telecommunications. The facilities are usually permanent, but they can also be temporary, since the president and vice president need access to sensitive information wherever they may be, including when on vacation. Fitzpatrick referred collectively to ""classified documents,"" but there are differing levels of classification, with escalating levels of security clearances required to view them. The least restrictive level is confidential; the most restrictive levels are top secret and above. Although all classified documents can be viewed in a SCIF, it is not required that documents in the least restrictive classification categories be viewed in those facilities. The facilities are used typically for materials categorized as ""top secret/sensitive compartmented information."" Classified documents below the top levels typically are stored, retained and viewed in classified spaces that are not SCIFs, said Bradley Moss, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who works on national security cases. These classified spaces do not have the same security guidelines as SCIFs, he said, though they are more restrictive than normal workspaces. The only information that must be protected in a SCIF is classified information derived from intelligence sources and methods, said Steven Aftergood, former director of the Federation of American Scientists Project on Government Secrecy.So, there is a broad swath of ""classified documents"" that is not required to be brought to a SCIF in the first place.Featured Fact-checkRick Scott stated on February 7, 2023 in an adPresident Joe Biden “cheated on his taxes and got away with it.”By Louis Jacobson • February 10, 2023Can highly secret material be removed from a SCIF?Even information classified as top secret/sensitive compartmented information may be removed from a SCIF as long as proper protocols are followed, experts said. The same is true for material with lower classifications.Molly Shadel, a University of Virginia law professor who formerly worked at the Justice Department, gave an example of a Justice Department lawyer working with top secret/sensitive compartmented information materials in a SCIF. The lawyer might find that some of the documents need to be presented to a judge, which would require an off-site meeting. ""In that situation, the lawyer would use a special DOJ-issued bag with special locks and other security features"" to transport the materials, Shadel said. ""But that lawyer would need to lock the materials up in a SCIF when she’s not using it, perhaps at a local FBI field office. She couldn’t just keep it overnight in her hotel room."" Moss said classified documents, no matter their level, ""cannot simply be removed and taken outside of any secured space without complying with security protocols."" However, he called Fitzpatrick’s characterization of the process an ""oversimplification.""Dietz said, ""Of course, Trump and Biden and every other (president and vice president) have taken sensitive information home. ""Therefore, it is not true that sensitive information can never leave a SCIF.""Deitz said that a president’s or vice president’s home might be considered tantamount to a SCIF.Finally, it’s unclear how relevant Fitzpatrick’s point is to the Biden case.CNN, The Washington Post and NBC, without naming sources, stated that some Biden documents included ""sensitive compartmented information."" If true, that would mean those documents require a SCIF. Meanwhile, the list of items taken by federal agents during the Mar-a-Lago search include materials described as ""various classified/TS/SCI documents."" The FBI photographed documents marked top secret found at Mar-a-Lago.Biden’s personal attorney, Bob Bauer, said in a Jan. 21 statement that Biden’s lawyers gave the Justice Department access to search his Wilmington home. The Jan. 20 search turned up ""six items consisting of documents with classification markings and surrounding materials, some of which were from the President’s service in the Senate and some of which were from his tenure as Vice President.""Our rulingFitzpatrick said, ""Classified documents can never be taken out of a (sensitive compartmented information facility), ever.""This is exaggerated. SCIFs must be used when documents with the highest-level classifications have to be reviewed. But even the most highly classified documents can be taken out of a SCIF, as long as specific precautions are taken that ensure similar levels of security. In addition, it’s not required that documents with lower levels of classifications be viewed in a SCIF in the first place. Fitzpatrick’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.We rate it Half True.RELATED: Trump is wrong; Biden did have the right to declassify records as VPRELATED: Read the Mar-a-Lago search warrant, what agents took",Brian Fitzpatrick,"January 24, 2023",half-true

Zero,"" McCarthy told Hannity Jan. 10. But when the Democrats ""were in power for four years,"" McCarthy said, ""they increased it by 30%.""This fact-check will focus on McCarthy’s claim about House Republicans’ spending record. Federal spending stemming from the recently ousted Democratic House majority is based on estimates that aren’t final.McCarthy’s office offered supporting evidence for his statement. However, other metrics tell a different story — and whether any holding pattern in spending can be credited to House Republicans is a more complicated question than McCarthy lets on.What is discretionary spending?Federal spending can be broken into a few broad categories. There’s mandatory spending, such as Social Security and Medicare; these programs effectively run on autopilot without annual appropriations passed by Congress. Another type of mandatory spending is interest on the federal debt.The federal spending beyond these categories is classified as ""discretionary."" Congress must appropriate it annually. One type of discretionary spending provides for U.S. military needs. The rest of discretionary spending is generally called ""nondefense discretionary spending.""McCarthy’s office pointed us to data from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office showing annual outlays for discretionary spending. Mark Bednar, a McCarthy spokesperson, flagged the period from fiscal year 2011 to fiscal year 2019, when Republicans controlled the House.McCarthy used a metric called ""outlays,"" which refers to actual federal dollars out the door during a given year. During that period, nondefense discretionary spending rose about 2%, from about $648 billion to $661 billion. Total defense and non-defense discretionary spending fell slightly, by less than 1%.

From fiscal year 2011 to 2019, nondefense discretionary spending decreased 26%, and total discretionary spending, including defense, fell by 28%.Budget authority vs. outlaysAn alternative way of examining the numbers — budget authority — may be more revealing, experts say.When Congress passes a spending bill, that bill may appropriate funding that’s intended to be spent not just in Year One but in Year Two, Year Three, and so on. ""Budget authority"" refers to the total amount of funding approved in the first year, even if it won’t be spent until later.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 23, 2023 in a Facebook postVideo shows Rep.

Van de Water, a senior fellow at the left-of-center Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""To see who did what and when, it’s better to use budget authority, not outlays.""During the same eight-year period that McCarthy’s office cited, fiscal years 2011 to 2019, budget authority for nondefense discretionary spending rose about 29%, from about $511 billion to about $658 billion. That’s much higher than the 2% increase for outlays.""Highly variable appropriations for things like disaster assistance … complicate the analysis of spending changes and trends,"" Van de Water said.McCarthy cited years that included Democratic leadership in the White House, SenateA more basic question that casts some doubt on McCarthy’s statement is the definition of ""in power."" McCarthy used Republicans’ control of the House as his metric. However, the House alone does not set spending levels; it must reach agreement with the Senate and the president. Although the party controlling the House can use its leverage to negotiate lower spending levels, it cannot enact its preferences on its own.For the eight-year period McCarthy cited, Barack Obama, a Democrat, served as president for the first six years, and Democrats controlled the Senate for the first four years. The only time during the period McCarthy cited when Republicans had unified control of the House, the Senate, and the presidency was in 2017 and 2018, during Donald Trump’s administration.

10,Yacob Reyes,"""Florida's water is dirtier and sicker than when Gov. DeSantis first took office.""","The early days of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' second term are brimming with news about water. In DeSantis' inaugural address Jan. 3, the Republican governor touted his investments to improve the state's water quality, and he promised that millions more will come in the next legislative session.Democratic state lawmakers aren’t sold on DeSantis' environmental success; one House member from St. Petersburg said the opposite is true. ""The results are clear — Florida's water is dirtier and sicker than when Gov. DeSantis first took office,"" state Rep. Lindsay Cross, D-St. Petersburg, said in a Jan. 3 statement.We wanted to know whether Florida's water quality had declined as Cross said. We quickly learned that the words chosen by Cross, an environmental scientist, aren't the same words that environmental agencies use to test and track water conditions.Cross also didn't specify what kind of water she was talking about. There are many different kinds of water bodies in Florida — lakes; rivers; springs; and beachfront waters (also called nearshore waters), to name a few. Each system has its own challenges, and there's no catch-all unit of measurement to summarize the health of all water in the state.When we asked Cross for evidence of her claim, she said: ""My statement refers to the state broadly, but particularly in our coastal estuaries."" She said algae blooms, including red tide and blue-green algae, are lasting longer and causing more damage.Estuaries are bodies of water where the freshwater from rivers or streams converges with the saltwater of the ocean. The largest estuary in Florida is Tampa Bay, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Here's what we found when we tested Cross’ claim. DeSantis’ press office directed us to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.More estuaries aren't meeting water quality standards under DeSantisWe reached out to Florida’s Department of Environmental Protection for information on the overall health of the state's water, but we did not receive a response in time for publication. As part of the federal Clean Water Act, the department must submit a biannual report on Florida's water bodies to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.This report provides an analysis of the bodies of water in Florida that have become too polluted for swimming or drinking. The department examines streams, lakes, estuaries, and coastal waters for water quality and outlines the root causes of pollution. PolitiFact reviewed the department reports from 2018, 2020 and 2022. We found that a growing number of the state’s water bodies are impaired — meaning, they do not meet water quality standards. In 2018, before DeSantis took office, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection reported that 2.5 million acres of the state's estuaries were polluted and not suitable for drinking or recreation. That number declined to 2.1 million in 2020 before growing to 3.1 million in 2022.That increase was fueled partly by a surge in nutrient pollution, which can worsen algae blooms that are toxic for wildlife and cause health complications for people swimming in or drinking from such waters.Florida's lakes and coastal waters face similar challengesOther bodies of water in Florida also experienced an initial decrease in pollution when DeSantis entered office and then an uptick toward the end of his first term. Featured Fact-checkRon DeSantisstated on January 17, 2023 in a press conference""Almost every study now has said with these new boosters, you're more likely to get infected with the bivalent booster.""By Yacob Reyes • January 20, 2023Lakes: In 2018, more than 1 million acres of lakes across Florida were identified as unsuitable for swimming and aquatic life. The count dropped to about 893,000 acres in 2020, before rising to 2.1 million in 2022. Coastal waters: Coastal waters, which include beachfront waters, had a far less dramatic shift in pollution. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection identified 2,718 miles of coast as impaired in 2018. The count fell to 1,529 miles in 2020 and rose to 1,570 in 2022. Florida’s streams had a consistent decline in miles of impaired water, however. In 2018, more than 70,000 miles of streams were polluted. By 2022, that dropped to 15,000. Cross mentioned red tide and blue-green algae blooms to support her assertion that the state’s waters are dirtier. Although red tide has been all over recent news, there's a data issue with comparing these events over time. We could not find data that compared the overall severity and extent of algal blooms from one calendar year to the next during DeSantis' tenure. ""In the Everglades and throughout Florida's lakes, harmful toxic algae blooms have become an almost annual event fed by fertilizer runoff from farms and subdivisions,"" the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit advocacy organization in Washington, D.C., concluded after reviewing state reports. The Environmental Integrity Project evaluated the latest water quality analyses submitted by each state. Its report was released March 17, 2022, a month before Florida released the latest data on the state's water. According to the report: Florida ranked first in the nation for total acres of lakes deemed too polluted for swimming and aquatic life. When looking at the percentage of lakes assessed, Florida ranked fourth. Florida also has the second most square miles of polluted estuaries in the U.S. It ranked ninth when looking at the percentage of estuaries assessed.While acknowledging the issues of Florida's water, experts said the problems are nothing new. ""Florida’s had water issues for as long as people have been selling real estate down here. So, these issues definitely predated DeSantis,"" said Matt DePaolis, environmental policy director at the nonprofit Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation.DeSantis also pursued several actions to improve the state’s water quality.

She added her false claim that voting machines attributed to her own loss to Katie Hobbs, Arizona’s Democratic secretary of state. ""Meet Luana Stoltenberg. She originally LOST her race for Iowa State House when Machines declared the Democrat the Winner,"" Lake wrote on her Twitter account. ""A Hand-Recount later reversed the results and gave Luana the WIN. I’m old enough to remember when an Obama judge dismissed my case against Machines."" Lake grew up in the Davenport area that includes the district Stoltenberg will represent beginning in January. It was controversial in Iowa, as Lake is in Arizona and nationally, so we decided to unpack the facts about Stoltenberg’s narrow win.On Nov. 9, the day after the Nov. 8 general election, Scott County’s unofficial election results showed Luana Stoltenburg, a Republican, in a close lead over her Democratic opponent Craig Cooper. She had a 29-vote margin in the House District 81 race, which covers northwest Davenport, on election night giving her the unofficial win in the District 81 race. On Nov. 10, the Scott County Auditor’s office discovered that 470 absentee ballots had not been counted in the election results. Scott County Auditor Kerri Tompkins, a Republican, ordered a Nov. 15 absentee ballot recount.However, during that recount, the machines tabulating absentee ballots frequently jammed and the ending totals didn’t match hand-counted audits of machine counts, Tompkins’ told the Quad-City Times. This resulted in a hand count of the ballots and another subsequent machine count where the totals were similar, but not the exact same.The machine-counted and hand-audited results showed Cooper in the lead by 6 votes. Tompkins said she was confident in the results, according to the Quad-City Times. The Scott County supervisors certified that canvass on Nov. 21 in a 4-1 vote, with Democrat Ken Croken voting no. Stoltenberg filed for a recount and a three-member recount board selected by the candidates conducted it as required by Iowa law. This board’s hand-counted tally found 45 fewer votes than the auditor had tallied in the November administrative recount: 31 fewer for Cooper and 11 fewer for Stoltenberg. Meanwhile, a machine recount by the recount board had the same results as the county canvass. Tompkins told the reporters she believes the recount board missed a box of votes that were counted by the machine. According to Iowa Code 50.48, the recount board has discretion over the report filed with the county auditor’s office for the county canvass.Featured Fact-checkRick Santorumstated on October 31, 2015 in a speech at the Republican Party of Iowa's Growth and Opportunity Party in Des Moines""I am the only person in this field who is against amnesty.

Kim Reynolds, Secretary of State Paul Pate, State Auditor Rob Sand, Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig and State Treasurer Michael Fitzgerald — finalized a state canvass from recounts in Iowa House Districts 59, 73 and 81 on Dec. 16. That board certified votes for all other races Dec. 1. Voting Machines aren’t the problemIowa’s voting systems don’t rely on Electronic Ballot Marking Systems that mark voters’ choices on paper ballots, in place of voters marking on the paper ballots themselves. Instead, Iowa hails paper ballot security while using vote tabulation machines that electronically count votes. Iowa audits voting tabulation machines before and after each election to ensure the accuracy of the vote counts. Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, a Republican, required hand-counted audits of two races per county in the 2022 midterm to ensure machine tabulations match hand-counted audits.""Our post-election audits consistently match the ballot tabulators perfectly,"" Pate wrote in a press release. ""Adding another race to the process gives greater protection, transparency, and security to the process. We want Iowans to know their vote counts.""The Brennan Center for Justice found that electronic voting systems like those used in Maricopa County’s elections in Arizona are more likely to fail than paper ballot systems. Lake has tried to discredit these electronic voting systems in her campaign by filing a lawsuit against Maricopa County to prohibit the use of voting machines there. However, the Federal Election Commission and independent audits have found Dominion voting systems, such as those in Maricopa County, are secure. Maricopa County performs audits before and after the election to ensure the accuracy of the vote tabulation.  The Lake campaign did not respond to our request for comment.Our rulingLake claimed in a tweet that voting machines erroneously gave a Democrat the win in the House District 81 race before a hand count overturned the result. However, a county canvass, not machines, declared Democrat Craig Cooper the winner, plus, Stoltenberg initially had been declared a winner after an election night count by machines. Election results are not final until certified by the Iowa State Board of Canvassers. Before that certification, though, a three-member panel selected a paper audit over the machine count and declared Stoltenberg the winner.

Sanders referred to both categories of uninsured and underinsured when he cited the 85 million figure in an October op-ed in The Guardian.Sanders drew from Commonwealth survey showing uninsured and underinsuredCasca referred us to a 2022 survey by the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation that is a respected source of health care research. The survey found that 43% of working-age adults 19 to 64, or about 85 million Americans, were uninsured or inadequately insured. Specifically: 9 % were uninsured11% had a gap in coverage over the past year, meaning that at some point during the year they did not have health coverage but weren’t without it for the entire year 23% were underinsured, meaning that they were insured all year but their coverage didn’t provide them with affordable access to health care. The Commonwealth Fund analysis defines underinsured as people who fit one of the following categories:Out-of-pocket costs over the prior 12 months, excluding premiums, were 10% or more of household incomeOut-of-pocket costs over the prior 12 months, excluding premiums, were 5% or more of household income for individuals living under 200% of the federal poverty level ($27,180 for an individual or $55,500 for a family of four in 2022)The deductible constituted 5% or more of household income.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 18, 2023 in a Facebook post“The average American has anywhere from 5 to 15 pounds” of stool stuck in their gut.By Madison Czopek • January 27, 2023People who were uninsured for a year or longer were disproportionately young, Hispanic, poor, unhealthy and living in the South.The most recent federal survey data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the 18-to-64 age group shows a slightly higher uninsured rate through 2022’s first half: 12.1%. When the CDC included all age groups, it showed 27.4 million people of all ages (8.3% of the population) were uninsured at the time of interview.Since the pandemic started in early 2020, Congress passed measures to improve access to health insurance. Federal and state policies contributed to an increase in public coverage in 36 states, leading to lower uninsured rates in 28 states in 2021 compared with 2020.Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at Kaiser Family Foundation, told us that if including people who lack health insurance or are underinsured, the 85 million Sanders cited is ""certainly a defensible statement.""""The number of Americans uninsured is at or near an all-time low,"" Levitt said. ""But, even among those who are insured, many have little savings and face high deductibles that leave them financially vulnerable if they get sick.""There’s not a strict definition of underinsurance, Levitt said.

The county in 2019 passed a resolution declaring themselves a ""Second Amendment preservation county"" and pledged not to spend money to ""initiate unconstitutional seizures."" U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a prominent supporter of federal gun restrictions, called out El Paso County and other places with these resolutions during an interview about the nightclub shooting on CNN.""The majority of counties in this country have declared that they are not going to enforce state and federal gun laws,"" Murphy said Nov. 27 on CNN’s ""State of the Union."" ""They have decided that they are going to essentially refuse to implement laws that are on the books. That is a growing problem in this country. ….60 percent of counties in this country are refusing to implement the nation's gun laws.""We wanted to know more about these counties and fact-check whether Murphy’s statistic was accurate. The number refers to the percentage of counties that have sanctuary policies, and by that metric it checks out.There is no universally understood definition of a so-called Second Amendment sanctuary, said Allison Anderman, senior counsel at Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. These broad policies about upholding the Second Amendment vary in each city, county or state. Some resolutions state that the jurisdiction won’t spend money to enforce what their officials deem unconstitutional gun laws. Some experts have said these resolutions are merely symbolic. But there is some evidence that Second Amendment sanctuary areas use the state’s red flag laws less than other jurisdictions. Many Colorado counties passed sanctuary resolutionsGun rights supporters demonstrate Jan. 20, 2020, in front of the state Capitol in Richmond, Va. (AP)Nineteen states and Washington, D.C., have red flag laws. They are a relatively new phenomenon, with Connecticut passing the first such law in 1999. Colorado’s law, which went into effect in 2020, allows law enforcement, family or household members to file a petition asking a court to take away gun rights from a person who poses a significant risk to themselves or others.Despite polls showing strong support for these policies, The Associated Press found that laws faced a backlash by politicians who passed ""Second Amendment sanctuary"" policies in about 2,000 counties. That number reflects about 60% of the nation’s counties, and was the source for Murphy’s statistic. We found one other source that backs up this figure from the website SanctuaryCounties.com, which compiles updates on these laws and says it is dedicated to ""law abiding, Constitution loving citizens who refuse to simply give up their Second Amendment rights.""The term ""sanctuary"" borrows from the sanctuary city policies that restrict state or local police from assisting federal immigration officers. Bryan Kibler, the former top prosecutor in Effingham County, Illinois, has been credited with devising the idea for Second Amendment sanctuaries. (Kibler is now a judge.)""We wanted to ... get across that our Second Amendment rights are slowly being stripped away,"" Kibler told the AP in 2018. Research suggests sanctuary counties employ red flag laws less often than counties without these resolutions.According to AP, 37 sanctuary counties in Colorado issued just 45 gun surrender orders over two years. Researchers from the University of Colorado compared the use of the state’s red flag law in 2020 in counties with and without these policies. Of the 37 ""sanctuary"" counties, 24% had at least one petition filed, versus 48% of counties without these resolutions. Second Amendment counties may create a chilling effect on filing petitions, they wrote, because people may incorrectly think the red flag laws are illegal.One of the researchers, Firearm Injury Prevention Initiative director Emmy Betz, said more study is needed. Her work covered a small sample and only one year of data. ""There’s active research now trying to understand how resolutions (or other geographic differences) may influence police/prosecution prioritization, but I don’t think we have a firm answer on that question right now,"" Betz told PolitiFact.Featured Fact-checkMark Obenshainstated on January 31, 2023 in a floor speech.“You know how many children are dying across Virginia because of fentanyl poisoning?

The sheriff who opposed the state law filed no petitions.Shawn Fields, a law professor at Campbell University who wrote an article about sanctuaries for Northwestern University Law Review, cautioned that correlation does not necessarily equal causation. ""Most (Second Amendment) sanctuary resolutions are merely symbolic in nature and have no enforcement mechanisms contained within them,"" Fields told PolitiFact. ""It is possible the existence of the resolutions are influencing police and prosecutor discretion in enforcing red flag laws. But it is equally possible that the resolutions themselves are merely reflections of a community already deeply skeptical about these types of firearms regulations, which may include police and prosecutors de-prioritizing their enforcement.""The newness of these sanctuary resolutions, combined with the pandemic’s potential effect on enforcement for a year and a half, means we have had very little time to assess the impact of these resolutions, Fields said. Virginia Beach declared itself a sanctuary but still prosecutes gun crimesIn this July 9, 2019, file photo, Moms Demanding Action line up during a rally at the State Capitol in Richmond, Va. Gov. Ralph Northam called a special session of the General Assembly to consider gun legislation in light of the Virginia Beach shootings.

It wouldn’t affect law enforcement officials, he said, because they are guided by the U.S. Constitution, the Virginia Constitution and state laws. ""Courts have the obligation of  interpreting the law, not the sheriff,"" said Stolle, a Republican, attorney and former state senator. ""My job is to enforce the law."" In 2020, Virginia passed a red flag law. The Virginia Beach office of the commonwealth attorney told us that it has filed 27 red flag cases. And the police department regularly arrests people involved in gun crimes.Polk County, Florida, also passed a sanctuary resolution in 2020. Sheriff Grady Judd is one of the state’s most prominent Republican supporters of red flag laws. WINK News, a PolitiFact partner, found that Polk County has had more risk-protection orders, which red flag laws allow law enforcement to seek, than anywhere else in the state over the past four years — about 1,300.Some statewide resolutions suggest noncompliance with future laws. ""The White House and U.S. Congress have announced their intention to pursue measures that would infringe on the right to keep and bear arms,"" reads Nebraska's Second Amendment sanctuary proclamation. ""Nebraska will stand up against federal overreach and attempts to regulate gun ownership.""Legal experts say counties can’t refuse to enforce lawsHow do these resolutions hold up legally?A county cannot refuse to enforce laws, and the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution requires that federal law take precedence over state and local law.Brady: United Against Gun Violence, which works to reduce gun violence, says courts have yet to take up a case that would answer whether the symbolic policies have any legal standing. But the vast majority of sheriffs are independently elected, so they have autonomy to set and enforce policy, said political scientist Emily Farris of Texas Christian University. Farris helped oversee a survey of American sheriffs and found about 38% opposed a requirement to confiscate firearms from people who pose a public safety risk.Our rulingMurphy said ""60 percent of counties in this country are refusing to implement the nation's gun laws.""Murphy’s statistic reflects an Associated Press analysis that found 2,000 counties have passed ""Second Amendment sanctuary"" policies pledging to not enforce some gun restrictions passed by their states. This represents about 60% of the nation’s 3,000 counties.But the resolutions do not necessarily mean that the jurisdiction doesn’t enforce gun laws — much less federal laws that take precedence over state and local laws.

14,Amy Sherman,"Herschel Walker “is heavily funded by the oil and gas industry, raking in more than $140,000 in donations from Big Oil and other energy interests.""","The League of Conservation Voters for decades has published a ""dirty dozen"" campaign to target candidates who side against the group’s environmental agenda. This year’s list includes Herschel Walker, the Republican running for U.S. Senate in Georgia.The league says on its website that Walker’s campaign ""is heavily funded by the oil and gas industry, raking in more than $140,000 in donations from Big Oil and other energy interests in the short time he’s been a candidate.""The league is supporting incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., in the Dec. 6 runoff. The league’s statement about the amount of donations to Walker’s campaign is in the ballpark. Although $140,000 sounds like a lot, it’s a small fraction of the millions he has raised. As of mid-November, Walker has raised $58 million. In the bigger picture, oil and gas industry entities or workers have significantly donated to outside groups that support Walker. And Warnock has raised about $150 million — $107,066 from people in the oil and gas industry.Walker’s oil and gas donationsThe League of Conservation Voters cited data from Open Secrets, a nonpartisan research group that tracks federal money in politics. One way Open Secrets analyzes the donations is to show how many dollars were given by donors who work in certain top industries, including oil and gas.The oil and gas category includes donations by people including multinational producers, natural gas distributors or liquid propane dealers. Although donations could be from anyone who works in the industry, they typically come from executives.The industry gives most of its campaign contributions to Republicans — although U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., was the top individual recipient during the 2021-22 cycle. Walker received $190,000 from the oil and gas industry, as of Oct. 28, Open Secrets’ analysis showed. The League of Conservation Voters’ figure of $140,000 comes from the total in July. People who donate to political candidates must list their occupation and employer if they give more than $200. Sometimes donors don’t provide that information. Warnock’s top industry donations were from individuals who said they were retirees; or from Democratic or liberal PACs or mostly individuals who associate with that ideology; or donors who worked in education. Walker’s top industries include $6.7 million from retirees, $1.6 million from donors aligned with Republicans or conservatives, and $1 million from the real estate sector. That means that the $190,000 from the oil and gas industry is on the lower end of his industry donations.Walker has raised about $58 million, but only about $13.6 million of those donations are reflected on Open Secrets’ industry analysis. Why the difference? The industry analysis  includes only the top industries, and some donors’ occupations aren’t listed. (There is also a slight difference in the dates of the data — the industry analysis is based on Federal Election Commission records available as of Oct. 28, while the total raised reflects reports through Nov. 16. It takes time for Open Secrets to classify donations by industry.)Featured Fact-checkInstagram postsstated on January 23, 2023 in social media posts on January 23, 2023Electrically charged stones discovered in Congo.By Loreben Tuquero • January 26, 2023However we slice it, oil and gas donations to Walker’s campaign account for a small percentage of his campaign donations. The oil and gas industry donations account for about 1% of the donations analyzed by industry, or about 0.3% of his total donations. In both scenarios, the donations don’t add up to the ""heavily funded"" description cited by the League of Conservation Voters.There have been sizable donations from oil and gas interests to outside political action committees, and some of those donations can be directly tied to Walker’s race:The American Petroleum Institute gave $1 million to the Senate Leadership Fund on Nov. 15. The Senate Leadership Fund, a group aligned with the Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell, is spending about $14 million on ads in the Senate runoff in support of Walker.Trevor Rees-Jones, the founder of Chief Oil & Gas, and his wife, Jan gave $100,000 in March to 34N22, a PAC that supports Walker. The PAC has spent about $6.1 million. Trevor also gave $14,500 directly to Walker’s campaign.Warnock donations from oil and gas What about Warnock? Open Secrets’ data shows that oil and gas was not a top industry donor to the senator, but he has received some donations: $107,066 in the midterm cycle. Open Secrets said $16,180 of that amount can be attributed to Warnock’s previous runoff election in January 2021.We asked League of Conservation Voters spokesperson Emily Samsel why it called out the donations to Walker and not Warnock. ""The difference is whether or not a candidate is willing to do the fossil fuel industry’s bidding,"" she said.Warnock supported the Inflation Reduction Act, which invests in renewable energy, and has called for reducing U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. That’s different from the stance taken by Walker, who said, ""What we need to do is keep having those gas-guzzling cars, 'cause we got the good emissions under those cars.""Our rulingThe League of Conservation voters said Walker ""is heavily funded by the oil and gas industry, raking in more than $140,000 in donations from Big Oil and other energy interests.""The league pulled the number in July from Open Secrets, a reliable source of federal campaign finance data. The amount of direct donations from the oil and gas industry to Walker’s campaign is now about $190,000. The claim could mislead voters into thinking that Walker has outsized support from the oil and gas industry. Viewed in the context of overall donations, that’s not the case. The money from oil and gas-aligned groups and employees amount to less than 1% of donations to his campaign — far from ""heavily.""

And Budd cosponsored a national abortion ban so out of the mainstream, it includes no exceptions for victims of rape or incest. And now this: Ted Budd voted to cut Medicare and Social Security and voted to raise the retirement age too—which means if Ted Budd becomes our senator, you will be working more and earning less.""PolitiFact has already checked claims about Budd’s family company and Budd’s stance on abortion. We wondered, though, whether Budd had actually voted to cut Medicare and Social Security.In an October debate, Budd said he will ""not touch"" Social Security and Medicare for those who are on it or ""near to receiving it."" Asked if young people could expect the same benefits, Budd said young people could stabilize Social Security by getting jobs and paying into it.As for Budd’s votes on the programs, it turns out there’s some truth to the ad’s claims as well as some missing context. In an email to PolitiFact North Carolina, the PAC cited Budd’s vote on a proposed amendment to the concurrent budget resolution passed for the fiscal year ending in 2018. The final version of the GOP-authored bill outlined how Congress should spend money and overhaul the tax codes for the next decade. The proposed amendment featured an alternative budget plan from the Republican Study Committee, a group of conservative House members focused on limiting government spending.

His recommendations remain the backbone of the RSC’s Social Security reform proposal — something Democrats are amplifying ahead of the midterm elections. Budd is a member of the RSC and this year thanked the group for including some of his proposals, saying: ""The RSC budget always provides a breath of fresh air to the liberal leadership we currently have in the House. … I’m proud to work with RSC to advance conservative principles.""As for the 2017 proposal, Senate Majority PAC pointed to an analysis conducted by the nonprofit Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. It said the RSC proposal, by adopting Johnson’s plan, would eliminate Social Security’s shortfall and make the program sustainably solvent by slowing initial benefit growth for higher-earners, gradually raising the normal retirement age to 69, and means-testing annual cost-of-living adjustments.An analysis by the Social Security Administration found that by 2030, the program would be about 25% smaller than it is today. Raising the retirement age cuts benefits for everyone, but that would come gradually. The current RSC proposal makes clear that changes would have ""no effect on those currently receiving Social Security benefits or those 55 and older.""""It looks like the RSC 2017 budget does change Social Security and Medicare, though it comes down to what we mean by ‘cutting’ those programs,"" said Garrett Watson, senior policy analyst and modeling manager at the Tax Foundation.Featured Fact-checkTweetsstated on January 24, 2023 in a tweetDiamond and Silk pundit died from COVID-19By Paul Specht • February 6, 2023""For example, Social Security reform would ‘slow initial benefit growth for higher-earners,’"" and do the other things highlighted by the Committee for a Responsible Budget,"" Watson said. ""That generates savings in the future but isn’t a cut to benefits today.""Researchers at the Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based policy organization, found that Johnson’s plan would pay lower-income beneficiaries more than they would receive if lawmakers did nothing and automatic cuts took place. It would shift payments from people with high incomes and lifetime earnings to those with lower incomes and lifetime earnings.Bill on Medicare, the debt ceilingAs for Medicare, the Committee for a Responsible Budget said the RSC’s proposed 2017 budget would have reduced Medicare spending by nearly $900 billion over a decade by converting Medicare to a premium support system for new beneficiaries, increasing means testing, and aligning the program’s eligibility age with the Social Security normal retirement age.The Senate Majority PAC also cited Budd's vote in December on S.610, known as the ""Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act."" Democrats have accused opponents of the bill of wanting to ""slash Medicare,"" a claim PolitiFact addressed last year.The bill itself did not cut Medicare. It staved off cuts to Medicare that would have happened automatically without congressional action. The bill suspended for three months a 2% Medicare ""sequester"" that was scheduled to begin at the end of the year and, separately, delayed a 4% cut to Medicare provider payments scheduled to start in January, Roll Call reported.That’s not all the bill did. The bill and its construction were controversial partly because Democrats tied the Medicare parts to legislation that raised the federal government’s debt limit by $2.5 trillion.Although 10 Republicans supported the bill in the Senate, almost no Republicans supported it in the House. Critics told Roll Call they believed Democrats could raise the debt ceiling on their own. Budd voted against the bill, saying in a Dec. 14 press release that the federal government should strive to ""operate with efficiency and fiscal responsibility,"" adding, ""I cannot participate in enabling Washington’s spending addiction.""The Budd campaign says the Senate Majority PAC’s accusations about Social Security are inaccurate partly because their on-screen citation is misleading. The ad cites an Oct. 5, 2017, vote on ""H. Con. Res. 71"" — the budget resolution — while their accusation is based on an amendment proposal to that budget.In an email, Budd campaign adviser Jonathan Felts described the ad as desperate.""It's been five years since this bill and no cuts have been made,"" he said. ""They are trying to find loopholes to hit Ted on because they have nothing.""Our rulingThe Senate Majority PAC says ""Ted Budd voted to cut Medicare and Social Security and voted to raise the retirement age, too.""Budd supported a proposal that would have retooled Social Security and, years from its implementation, would have provided some Americans with fewer benefits than recipients are currently offered. He also voted against a bill that protected Medicare from scheduled cuts.However, the ad ignores that the proposed Social Security changes were not immediate. It also overlooks key details of Budd’s vote last December: he voted against a bill that raised the debt ceiling and staved off cuts to Medicare. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Vega — who opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when a mother’s life is endangered — was asked what Congress should do if the U.S. Supreme Court overturned its Roe v.

She added, ""The left will say, ‘Well, what about in cases of rape or incest?’ I'm a law-enforcement officer. I became a police officer in 2011.

18,Alexis Waiss,"Abraham Hamadeh says he will “lock up doctors, nurses, pharmacists” and “punish women for abortion.”","In 1864, almost 50 years before Arizona officially became a state, the territory passed a law that said anyone who helps a woman miscarry can be put in jail. More than 100 years later, this law has become a central issue in the state’s attorney general race. Democratic candidate Kris Mayes claims her opponent, Abraham Hamadeh, would target women and doctors for abortion law violations. ""My opponent, has affirmed he will indeed lock up doctors, nurses, pharmacists, etc. and punish women for abortion, with zero exceptions for rape or incest,"" Mayes tweeted Sept. 25.Hamadeh’s campaign called this statement a ""blatant misrepresentation."" ""Abe has never said he supports the (abortion) ban outright, only that the attorney general has a duty to defend the law regardless of their personal opinion,"" Hamadeh’s campaign said in an Oct.14 emailed statement, echoing an earlier tweet. Hamadeh has said that he is pro-life. In March, the state passed a law that bans abortions after 15 weeks, with protecting the mother’s life and physical health as the only exception. There are no exceptions for rape or incest.Pending court rulings, it is unclear whether Arizona will follow the 1864 version, or the one passed in March. But in either case, health care providers are at risk, and pregnant women are not.The pre-statehood law criminalizes any action ""procuring a misscarriage"" as an offense that can put Arizonans in prison for two to five years. Jenn Piatt, an Arizona State University research scholar specializing in public health law, said the law would imprison only people who provide abortions. ""Generally speaking, the 1901 pre-statehood law would subject health care providers to potential criminal sentences, if it eventually is found enforceable,"" Piatt said. ""The way the law is drafted indicates that the law does not specifically aim at targeting a pregnant woman or pregnant person for prosecution.""The 1864 law, which was codified in 1901, faces legal challenges. Although a Sept. 22 county Superior Court ruling allowed the pre-statehood law to take effect, the ruling was blocked two weeks later after the Arizona Court of Appeals accepted a stay filed by Planned Parenthood Arizona.Featured Fact-checkTrent Franksstated on April 14, 2016 in a legislative hearing""Today in America, between 40 and 50 percent of all African-American babies, virtually 1-in-2, are killed before they are born.""By Anthony Cave • April 26, 2016Arizona’s more recent abortion law also has penalties for physicians, but rather than specifying jail time, the law punishes them with a $10,000 fine and the removal of their medical license. There is no exception for rape or incest.The law specifically says the pregnant woman will not be prosecuted.Hamadeh’s campaign said Mayes is wrong to focus on the penalties because enforcing the law would fall outside the authority of the attorney general’s office.""The attorney general does not have primary jurisdiction to enforce the abortion criminal provisions,"" Hamadeh’s campaign said in a statement. ""Instead the authority falls on the county attorneys.""That generally reflects the state’s rules, Piatt said.""The Arizona attorney general’s position on an abortion ban may differ from county prosecutors in Arizona,"" said Piatt. ""Those county prosecutors retain their own prosecutorial discretion and may choose either to bring or not to bring specific charges.""However, Piatt noted that attorneys general can negotiate a shared approach with the counties, as they hold ""supervisory authority"" over county attorneys.Attorneys general also have their own prosecutors who could step in, especially if a criminal activity crosses county lines. That could occur, for example, if a pregnant woman lived in one county and the abortion provider lived in another.  Our Ruling Mayes said that Hamadeh said he would ""lock up doctors, nurses, pharmacists"" and ""punish women for abortion.""Hamadeh has said he would enforce state law, whatever it may be. Whether the abortion law from 1864 or the one passed this year prevails, those who assist in performing abortions face criminal penalities.

Por que al final tu quieres a alguien que te represente y apoye los valores y ayude a solucionar nuestros problemas"", la mujer dice en el anuncio del 18 de octubre publicado por el Florida Immigrant Coalition, una alianza de organizaciones que abogan por los inmigrantes.El subtítulo de la publicación crítica el historial de votos de Rubio frente al programa de Acción Diferida para los Llegados en la Infancia (DACA, por sus siglas en inglés). El programa fue creado durante la administración del Presidente Barack Obama, y evita la deportación de aquellos inmigrantes que entraron a Estados Unidos de manera ilegal cuando eran niños. ""Marco Rubio le ha votado en contra a los Dreamers, jóvenes inmigrantes traídos a Estados Unidos de pequeños, para que pueden tener una oportunidad digna a su ciudadanía. Al hacer esto le está tronchando sus sueños y su futuro"", dice el subtítulo. Como evidencia para respaldar la declaración, el grupo Florida Immigrant Coalition le envió a PolitiFact un artículo del Tampa Bay Times sobre unos votos de Rubio en febrero de 2018. Rubio votó en contra de dos propuestas que incluían un camino hacia la ciudadanía para los beneficiarios de DACA. Pero también apoyó otra propuesta que también incluía un camino a la ciudadanía para estos inmigrantes. La mayor diferencia entre las propuestas tenía que ver con temas de seguridad fronteriza e inmigración legal, no con la posible ciudadanía para los inmigrantes que llegaron al país cuando eran niños. Votos de Rubio sobre DACA en 2018En 2017, la administración del Presidente Donald Trump intentó terminar el programa de acción diferida. Ese mismo año un grupo de fiscales generales a nivel estatal demandaron a la administración para mantener el programa de pie. En 2020, el caso llegó a la Corte Suprema de Estados Unidos, la cual falló en contra de la decisión del gobierno de acabar con el programa. Mientras el caso estaba en litigio, el congreso trabajó para crear una solución legislativa para los beneficiarios del programa. Trump le había otorgado a los congresistas un plazo hasta el 5 de marzo de 2018 para finalizar una propuesta apoyada por ambos partidos.La administración de Trump publicó una estrategia política que apoyaría, la cual incluía: financiamiento para proyectos de seguridad fronteriza, estatus legal para los beneficiarios del programa de acción diferida, límites en la inmigracion de familiares y la eliminación del programa de visas de diversidad. El 15 de febrero de 2018, el senado votó sobre tres propuestas que proveerían un camino hacia la ciudadanía para los beneficiarios de DACA.

Rubio ha afirmado que el congreso tiene la responsabilidad de crear una solución permanente para aquellos inmigrantes que llegaron a Estados Unidos de manera ilegal de niños. Ha sido menos consistente en su opinión sobre en qué momento se debe acabar el programa. En ciertos momentos Rubio ha apoyado la idea de que el programa se debe terminar solo después de que se llegue a una solución legislativa.

Catherine Cortez Masto and her Republican opponent Adam Laxalt have attacked each other’s records on crime and the opioid crisis. Both served as the state’s attorney general.Cortez Masto is also spotlighting Laxalt’s stance on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, an Obama-era program that prevents the deportation of immigrants who entered the United States illegally as children.""I have an opponent right now who isn't just anti-DACA. He actually fought against the protections for DACA recipients when he was attorney general,"" Cortez Masto tweeted Oct. 13. ""He used his power to attack people who were brought to this country as children.""But I have an opponent right now who isn't just anti-DACA. He actually fought against the protections for DACA recipients when he was attorney general.He used his power to attack people who were brought to this country as children.https://t.co/StSSP2v5aa— Catherine Cortez Masto (@CortezMasto) October 13, 2022 The tweet links to an Axios article that said Laxalt spent $13,000 in radio ads ""touting his opposition to protections for immigrants who were brought to the country as children.""As he sought the Republican nomination, Laxalt ran TV and radio ads promoting his success in a lawsuit against the Obama administration. He argued DACA amounted to granting ""amnesty for illegal immigrants."" He joined a lawsuit against an expansion of DACA, but did not join a lawsuit against the program’s original version because it already had beneficiaries. DACA overviewThe Department of Homeland Security secretary created DACA via a 2012 memorandum. DACA does not grant legal immigration status to its beneficiaries, but it protects them from deportation and allows them to apply for work permits and a Social Security number. These protections and benefits are provided in two-year renewable intervals.To qualify for DACA, people must meet specific requirements related to their age and the time frame in which they arrived in the United States. They are ineligible if they have been convicted of a felony, certain misdemeanors, or if they pose a threat to national security or public safety.In November 2014, DHS issued a memo expanding DACA eligibility (regarding age and arrival date). It also created a similar program to benefit parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. Laxalt’s legal challenges against DACA As Nevada’s attorney general in January 2015, Laxalt joined 24 other states in a lawsuit against President Barack Obama’s implementation of the expanded version of DACA, introduced in 2014, and the new program for parents. The lawsuit argued that the 2014 memo violated the Administrative Procedure Act — a law that describes how federal agencies can make and enforce regulations. Featured Fact-checkPublic Interest Legal Foundationstated on January 18, 2023 in a reportIn California, there were “10 million mail ballots unaccounted for” in the November midterm election.By Jeff Cercone • January 26, 2023""Our immigration system is broken and clearly needs to be fixed. But just as clearly, the solution is not for the president to act unilaterally disregarding the U.S. Constitution and laws,"" Laxalt said in a 2015 statement.Cortez Masto’s team pointed PolitiFact to Laxalt’s decision to join the lawsuit as evidence for her claim that he fought against protections for DACA recipients.The attorneys general’s case rose to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016, which left in place a lower court’s decision blocking DACA’s expansion and the new program for parents of U.S. citizens and green card holders.In 2017, when the Trump administration tried to rescind the original version of DACA, 15 attorneys general sued the government aiming to keep DACA protections in place. Laxalt did not join that lawsuit.The Supreme Court ruled against the Trump administration in a 5-4 decision.In 2018, nine states sued the Trump administration, claiming the original DACA program was created illegally.Laxalt did not join this lawsuit. He drew a distinction between suing to end a program that already has enrollees (original DACA) and suing to end an expansion of that program and a program that had no beneficiaries. This year, a federal appeals court ruled DACA illegal. However, it remains in place for active beneficiaries while a lower court analyzes the Biden administration’s changes to the program. These included making the application for DACA and the work permit two separate processes, and implementing a public comment period to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act. Our rulingCortez Masto tweeted that Adam Laxalt is ""anti-DACA"" and ""fought against the protections for DACA recipients when he was attorney general."" Laxalt and 24 other attorneys general sued to stop the Obama administration from expanding DACA and creating a new program that would benefit parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents.That lawsuit didn’t seek to revoke protections for people already in the program, but aimed to restrict the number of additional people who could benefit from it.It’s worth noting that Laxalt did not join another lawsuit to end the original version of DACA; he said it was because people were already enrolled in the program.The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

25,Jill Terreri,"New York state is outpacing the rest of the country, because shootings in New York are down 10%, and across the country the drop is only 2%.","Gov. Kathy Hochul claimed that shootings in New York State are falling faster than in the rest of the country.Hochul, a Democrat, is running for re-election against Republican U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin, who has accused her of being soft on crime. In a speech about public safety, she said that compared to last year, shootings are down. ""Shootings across the state of New York are down 10% from one year ago,"" she said. ""And we're outpacing the rest of the country — as you know, this is a national phenomenon, the gun violence, national phenomenon — we are outpacing the country, where on average across America, the drop is only 2%.""We wondered whether this comparison is correct, and whether New York outpaces the rest of the country. We approached the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services for the source of Hochul’s claim. The first part of the claim, that shootings dropped 10%, comes from the state’s Division of Criminal Justice Services. The agency collects data about shootings from 20 major police departments across upstate and Long Island: Albany, Binghamton, Buffalo, Hempstead, Jamestown, Kingston, Middletown, Mt. Vernon, Nassau County, Niagara Falls, Newburgh, Poughkeepsie, Rochester, Schenectady, Spring Valley, Suffolk County, Syracuse, Troy, Utica and Yonkers. Notably, New York City is not on the list.Between Jan. 1 and Aug. 31, 2022, and the same period in 2021, shooting incidents in which at least one person was injured or killed dropped 10%, according to the report, known as the Gun Involved Violence Elimination Initiative, or GIVE. The report showed 840 such incidents in 2021 and 756 incidents in 2022. The number of people injured or killed in these incidents decreased by 10.8%, but the number of people who died in gun violence incidents grew by 4.1%. The report also found a 25.6% increase in shootings involving injuries or deaths in 2022 compared with the average of the previous five years, 2017 to 2021.  We asked Christopher Herrmann, an assistant professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, about Hochul’s claim. He called the state’s report on shootings a reliable source.Herrmann, who previously analyzed statistics for the New York City Police Department, said shootings are also down in New York City, where shootings fell 12.6% in the first nine months of 2022 compared with the same period in 2021. The number of shootings there have continued to fall.  The second part of the governor's claim, that shootings are down 2% nationwide, comes from a New York Times newsletter,  according to Janine Kava, director of public information for the Division of Criminal Justice Services. The newsletter on Sept. 23 reported a 2% decrease in shootings, and it linked to the Gun Violence Archive, a national database of shooting incidents.The Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit, collects data on shootings from more than 7,500 sources, including police departments and local news outlets. Its searchable database has information on each shooting with details such as where the incident happened and how many people were injured or died. We spoke with the archive’s executive director, Mark Bryant, who said that Hochul’s claim of a 2% drop in shootings across the country is correct. ""Everything we’ve seen this year lines up to about 2%,"" Bryant said. Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 26, 2023 in a postThe officers who beat Tyre Nichols targeted him because he was “allegedly dating” one of their wives.By Madison Czopek • February 1, 2023He noted that New York City has seen fewer shootings, despite some headline-grabbing crimes. But he warned against comparing results from two different data sets that contain different types of data.  For example, the Gun Violence Archive tracks all incidents involving a gun, but the state’s GIVE report does not. Murder-suicides with a firearm are included in the state’s report, but suicides, officer-involved shootings and accidental shootings are not. The Gun Violence Archive includes all of these categories. However, anyone searching the database can filter them out. The GIVE report includes busy police departments upstate and on Long Island but does not include all departments, while the Gun Violence Archive records shooting data regardless of jurisdiction. We searched the Gun Violence Archive for all incidents in which at least one person was injured or died in a shooting, and we found the decrease in these incidents in New York State between Jan. 1 and Aug. 31, 2021, and the same period in 2022, was 3.8%, not 10%. Our search included accidental deaths and suicides, which were likely outside the purview of Hochul’s remarks, made during a speech to law enforcement.  When accidental deaths, suicides, and officer-involved shootings are removed from the Gun Violence Archive search results for New York State, the decline in shootings between Jan. 1 and Aug. 31, 2021, and the same period in 2022, is 3%. We approached the Hochul administration with the search results from the Gun Violence Archive and our finding that New York State’s decline in shootings compared to the decline in the rest of the country is much narrower than Hochul makes it seem in her statement. In the absence of a nationwide, federal database that uses consistent definitions for reporting gun violence, the state used the Gun Violence Archive data cited by The New York Times to provide perspective on the issue, as the increase in gun violence since 2020 has not been limited to New York State, said Kava, a spokesperson for the state’s Division of Criminal Justice Services. The administration noted New York City’s decline in shootings, 13.6% as of Oct. 16, and sent data from three other big cities, year-over-year, where shootings have fallen slightly or not at all. The decline in shooting victims is 2% in Los Angeles. Shootings increased elsewhere, by 2.3% in Baltimore and by 1.34% in Philadelphia.   The administration stands by the data Hochul cited, Kava said.  Our rulingHochul claimed New York State is doing better than the rest of the country in the number of shootings, saying they dropped 10% in New York and 2% in the rest of the country. A state report of 20 police agencies does show a 10% drop in shooting incidents. A different database shows a 2% drop in shootings across the country. But comparing these results can be misleading, because they don’t contain all of the same types of shooting incidents, and the state report includes only some geographic areas. Independent of each other, Hochul cited reliable statistics. In New York, shootings appear to be down more than in the rest of the country, though it’s not clear by how much. Comparing New York with the rest of the country, as she did, mixes data sources and can give a misleading impression about where New York stands. The Gun Violence Archive, the source for her claim of a 2% drop across the country, shows a much smaller drop in New York state during the same period — a 3% or a 3.8% drop, depending on which types of shootings are counted. We rate her statement Half True.",Kathy Hochul,"• October 24,",half-true

Where have I heard this before,"" read a caption with the post.We found numerous social media posts that also shared the Daily Mail headline, all alluding to the unproven theory that COVID-19 was created in a Chinese lab. They were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While scientists at Boston University’s National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories did undertake research that involved creating a hybrid COVID-19 strain, the headline omitted important context about the purpose of the study, the safety measures undertaken during the study and its results.The study, conducted in mice, reflected a common method for studying viruses and was not carried out dangerously, the university and other experts we spoke with said. What’s more, the study found that this hybrid strain was actually less fatal in mice than the original — not more.Ronald Corley, director of the Boston University laboratory, said attention given to the 80% figure has been used to promote a ""sensationalized"" message.""This was a statement taken out of context for the purposes of sensationalism,"" Corley said in a statement released by the university, ""and it totally misrepresents not only the findings, but (also) the purpose of the study.""About the studyIn the preprint study, which is not yet peer-reviewed, researchers at the Boston lab wanted to examine the spike protein in COVID-19’s original omicron variant, called Ba.1. Their aim was seeing whether the mutations in those proteins were the reason why the virus variant is milder than earlier COVID-19 strains and evades immunity more easily, but leads to fewer fatalities.To do so, the researchers added a spike protein from omicron to an original strain of SARS-CoV-2 to create a new strain they called Omi-S. They then compared the effects that the virus’s new strain, ancestral strain and omicron strain had on infected mice.All of the mice infected with the ancestral strain died.All the mice infected with omicron survived. And 80% of the mice infected with Omi-S died.Researchers concluded the results showed the lesser severity of omicron is not linked to the spike protein mutations. They said more research is needed.The mice that were used were ""a particular type of mouse that is highly susceptible,"" Corley said. ""Consistent with studies published by others, this work shows that it is not the spike protein that drives omicron pathogenicity, but instead other viral proteins. Determination of those proteins will lead to better diagnostics and disease management strategies,"" said Mohsan Saeed, one of the study’s lead authors, in a statement provided by Boston University.""Ultimately, this research will provide a public benefit by leading to better, targeted therapeutic interventions to help fight against future pandemics,"" the school’s statement said.About the study’s safetyThe headline shared in these posts derived from an Oct. 17 article in the U.K. news outlet the Daily Mail, which Boston University officials criticized as being misleading. The article, which has been updated with a new headline and additional critique of the study, quotes experts who said the research was an example of ""gain-of-function"" research, a broadly defined term about research that can potentially make a virus more dangerous.But the school and other experts we spoke with rejected that assertion.

He said it’s inappropriate to compare the Omi-S strain in this study with the original omicron strain, which killed none, because only the original strain was manipulated.Andy Pekosz, a microbiology and immunology professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the study’s work with COVID-19 is not unusual, pointing to two earlier similar studies.""This is a common approach to map differences between two related lineages of SARS-CoV-2 and, in fact, it's done with many different viruses,"" Pekosz said. ""By swapping large parts of the virus, you can determine more quickly which mutations might alter a virus’s fitness or replication.""Boston University also noted that the ""research mirrors and reinforces the findings of other, similar research performed by other organizations, including the FDA.""Scientists at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration co-authored a similar study published in September.The Boston research was conducted in the lab’s biosafety level 3 facilities, which allow researchers to work with dangerous pathogens. The lab is owned and operated by the school but it is part of a network of such sites around the U.S. where researchers can study infectious diseases.Pekosz called the facility ""a safe way to handle even the most dangerous of SARS-CoV-2 variants."" Gigi Gronvall, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said critics are ignoring the ""extraordinary safety measures"" taken in places such as the Boston lab, and that such research is vital.""Safety comes first, but there is no indication that there was a safety problem,"" Gronvall said. ""Understanding viruses like the one we are dealing with and which has killed millions requires, you know, studying it."" Safety measures in the lab include a series of interlocked doors; sealed walls and floors; and sophisticated filtration and decontamination technology, according to the school.But these labs aren’t risk-free, as a Vox article noted. It recalled a case of a lab worker in Taiwan being bitten with an infected mouse and later exposing the virus to more than 100 people.In an interview with the health news site STAT, Emily Erbelding, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ division of microbiology and infectious diseases, expressed misgivings that the Boston researchers did not alert the agency to the type of work being done.""We wish that they would have,"" Erbelding said, though she also noted the media coverage overstated the risk of the work being done.Boston University in its statement said it had no obligation to report its work to NIAID. The NIAID funded tools and platforms used in the research but did not fund the research directly, it said.The research was approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee and the Boston Public Health Commission, the school said.We reached out to NIAID for comment but didn’t immediately hear back. But an NIAID spokesperson told the Financial Times that the agency was ""examining the matter to determine whether the research conducted was subject to the NIH grants policy statement or met the criteria for review"" under government research guidelines.Dr. Anthony Fauci, NIAID’s director, said in an Oct 19 interview with CBS News that although the NIH did not fund the Boston study, ""it was interpreted I think in an exaggerated way by some as being of great concern.""Our rulingAn Instagram post shared an image of a headline that read, ""Boston University creates a new COVID strain that has an 80% kill rate.""This is partly accurate. Researchers at Boston University are investigating what made COVID-19’s omicron variant less deadly and more likely to evade immunity. In that effort, they added a spike protein from a milder omicron virus to an original strain of SARS-CoV-2 to create a new strain they called Omi-S. When researchers compared the effects of the three viruses on mice, they found that 80% of the Omi-S-infected mice died.But citing the 80% figure alone leaves out key context, including that the resulting strain was less fatal than the original, which killed 100% of mice. Experts say this kind of research is not unusual and the experiment was conducted in accordance with accepted safety procedures. The mice used were highly susceptible to the virus.

She said dogs suffering pain is part of lab testing, but that the lab Oz oversaw did not design tests to limit suffering and caused suffering by waiting unnecessarily long to euthanize some dogs.Dell’Orto told Billy Penn the experiments were meant to ""model human cardiac failure"" and to assess treatments. Logs showed that puppies were not properly sedated before being euthanized and that an outdated euthanasia solution was used. Also, paperwork did not show that a dog exercise plan was approved by the attending veterinarian.Oz’s campaign provided to PolitiFact the 22-page internal investigation report from Columbia, which covered Oz and other researchers.

The report said lab records did not say why the two other dogs were kept alive — one for two days and the other for nearly a month — after being paralyzed. The references in the ad to dog 6313 leaking blood and struggling to breathe were from a summary published by the advocacy group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Billy Penn reported that before the settlement, PETA had complained of abuse of baboons and dogs at Columbia after being contacted by Dell’Orto.In October, the news and cultural commentary website Jezebel reported that, based on studies in academic journals Oz published  from 1989 to 2010, experiments Oz supervised resulted in the deaths of at least 329 dogs. Oz’s campaign said Oz ""never abused any animals"" and noted that the whistleblower said Oz was not involved in euthanizing dogs.Our rulingSenate Majority PAC said a dog endured ""unimaginable pain and suffering"" during heart research experiments, ""just one of 300 killed in (Dr. Mehmet) Oz’s lab."" The ad’s focus on a dog known as 6313 is misleading.

The Henry Hub is a natural gas distribution site in southern Louisiana; gas comes in from pipelines and is then redirected to other pipelines as demand requires. The ""spot price"" at the hub ""reflects the going rate for gas purchased right now,"" said Hugh Daigle, a professor in the University of Texas at Austin’s Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering. Manchin’s office cited the change in prices between August 2017 and August 2022, when the spot price rose from $2.98 to $7.88. That’s an increase of 164%, which is substantial, but not quite the 200% Manchin cited in the tweet.More importantly, the increase is also more modest if you focus on annual averages rather than monthly figures, which helps smooth out some of the month-to-month volatility.Between 2017 and 2022, the yearly average rose from $2.99 to $6.23, or an increase of 108%, which is significant, but only about half of the 200% increase Manchin cited.

""In fact, gas itself is often a relatively small share of the price that consumers pay on their gas bills.""Residential consumer prices are up, though at a slower rate than wholesale prices have risen over the same period.Between 2017 and 2022 (using the same method for approximating the 2022 figure — data for the 12 most recent months), the price of natural gas delivered to consumers rose from $10.91 to $16.74, or an increase of about 53%.!function(e,i,n,s){var t=""InfogramEmbeds"",d=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(""script"");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,""infogram-async""); Overall, Williams said, ""prices are much, much higher than they used to be.

Abigail Spanberger, D-Va.,  of voting to send COVID-19 stimulus checks to people who are incarcerated — the disclosure that most congressional Republicans also voted to allow it.The ad, sponsored by the National Republican Congressional Committee, blames Spanberger of voting for ""wasteful spending,"" such as ""nearly $1 billion in stimulus checks for prisoners, including domestic terrorists."" A shaded picture appears of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the Boston Marathon bombers in 2013.Republicans have aired similar ads in congressional races around the country. They refer to House and Senate votes in March 2021 on the American Rescue Plan Act, a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package that was ultimately signed by President Joe Biden. Among other things, the act provided stimulus payments of up to $1,400 for single tax filers earning less than $75,000 a year and $2,800 to married couples filing jointly who made less than $150,000. Tax filers could get an additional $1,400 for each of their dependent children.Democrats pushed the bill through Congress on partisan votes, saying the relief was vital. Republicans said the bill was a boondoggle and, during a lengthy Senate debate, offered amendments to put Democrats on the record regarding certain policy points.Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Bill Cassidy, R-La., put forward an amendment that would prevent the stimulus checks from going to people in prisons. The amendment failed on a party-line vote. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said it would harm the families of those incarcerated.""Given the stark racial disparities in our criminal justice system, this would cause the most harm to Black and brown families and communities already harmed by mass incarceration,"" Durbin said on the Senate floor. ""Children should not be forced to go hungry because a parent is incarcerated.""Imprisoned people qualified for stimulus payments because of broad eligibility requirements in the relief bill — and others before it. All citizens and legal residents who filed a tax return or completed an Internal Revenue Service form requesting payment, were eligible for a check. The act provided 597,000 incarcerated people with stimulus checks totaling $863 million, according to estimates by the Department of the Treasury.The amendment was defeated and the relief act passed in the Senate on 50-49 party-line vote with Democrats in the majority.Four days later, the House approved the bill on a 220-211 vote, with Spanberger and all but one Democrat favoring it and Republicans unanimously opposing it. Democrats did not allow Republicans to introduce amendments before this vote because they needed to pass an exact copy of the Senate bill to advance it to Biden’s desk.Weeks earlier in debate, however, House Republicans had opportunities to amend the bill and did not try to add a ban on incarcerated people getting checks.Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on January 17, 2023 in an Instagram postCNN reported that Damar Hamlin’s doctor confirmed his cardiac arrest was caused by a COVID-19 vaccine booster.By Ciara O'Rourke • January 19, 2023While criticizing Democrats for their votes, the RNCC omits that most Republican members of Congress allowed incarcerated people to receive checks by voting for two earlier rounds of coronavirus stimulus. Both the CARES Act in March 2020 and a supplemental package in December 2020 allowed people in prisons to receive checks. The measures passed with overwhelming bipartisan support with the goal of speedily getting checks to citizens. The issue of imprisoned people receiving stimulus checks was not new when the American Relief Plan Act came up in early 2021. After President Donald Trump signed the CARES Act a year earlier, the IRS issued guidance saying the relief checks could not go to incarcerated people. In October 2020, a federal judge ruled against the IRS and said the government had to issue the checks because the CARES Act had no language restricting the payment to people in prisons.This is important because Republicans afterward supported the second stimulus, in December 2020, that also allowed payments to people who are incarcerated. Spanberger, who supported all three coronavirus stimulus bills, has no regrets. Justin Chermol, her campaign spokesperson, said she backed the American Rescue Plan because ""Virginia families were struggling to keep up with expenses, small businesses and restaurants needed additional relief to keep their doors open, and COVID-19 vaccination and testing sites needed additional support.""Boston Marathon bomberAs the RNCC ad claims, a $1,400 relief check was deposited in Tsarnaev’s prisoner account in June 2021.

31,Louis Jacobson,"The Biden administration has “created” more than double the number of jobs per month, on average, than any other administration going back to George H.W. Bush.","The White House recently created an Instagram post featuring a chart that touted the scale of job creation under President Joe Biden. Multiple readers asked us to take a closer look at it.The Oct. 8 post showed a bar graph headlined, ""Jobs created by president, average per month."" The graph included Biden and the last five presidents: George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump.        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by The White House (@whitehouse) According to the graph, the contest wasn’t close: Biden had created a bit more than 500,000 jobs per month on average, or more than twice the rate of his closest competitor, Clinton.But economists say the comparison isn’t apples to apples. Specifically, Biden has served in office for less than two years, while the elder Bush and Trump served for four, and Clinton, the younger Bush and Obama served for eight.Why does this matter? Because the longer presidents serve in office, the likelier it is they will encounter an economic downturn. And the job losses during economic downturns are what hamper the job-creation averages for presidents. Biden, for now, hasn’t faced an officially declared recession. By contrast, the elder Bush experienced one in the middle of his term, the younger Bush faced one at both the start and the end of his presidency, Obama entered office with the Great Recession raging, and Trump was in office when the coronavirus pandemic hit, which created a steep, if short-lived, recession. Only Clinton was lucky enough to avoid a recession. But he served in office for a period more than four times as long as Biden has so far, and the more months one serves, the greater the likelihood that the average job creation number tends to flatten out.Biden’s strong monthly job-creation averages reflect the economic cycle when he entered office. He was inaugurated in January 2021, as the nation was recovering from the steep and sudden job losses stemming from the pandemic’s onset in 2020. The jobs recovery began under Trump, but because he was out of office only eight months into the recovery, much of the job gains accrued during Biden’s time in the White House.""This is literally evidence that Biden was handed something on a golden platter,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank.

However, the labor force’s size has grown considerably since George H.W. Bush’s presidency. Thanks to overall population growth, the labor force is now more than one-third larger than it was at the beginning of the elder Bush’s tenure, making the big increases under Biden less meaningful, relatively speaking. Therefore, a more telling (but still imperfect) measurement is the percentage increase of jobs on a president’s watch. And using this metric, Biden is not the leader. !function(e,i,n,s){var t=""InfogramEmbeds"",d=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(""script"");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,""infogram-async""); Using percentage increase, Biden trails his two Democratic predecessors — Clinton, with an almost 21% increase, and Obama, with a bit under 9%. Biden’s increase checks in at 7%. Another complication for making presidential comparisons like these is that the rate of expansion of the labor force has varied from president to president, said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, a research and policy center in Washington, D.C. By this metric, Biden’s record looks a bit better, Burtless said.The ""prime-age population"" — essentially, the number of people ages 25 to 54 — grew rapidly during the elder Bush’s four years in office and Clinton’s eight. But this growth has slowed under subsequent presidents, including Biden. And not benefiting from a turbocharged population increase makes the increase on Biden’s watch impressive, Burtless said. ""Recent administrations — including Obama’s and Trump’s as well as Biden’s — have faced this headwind,"" he said.Finally, the White House’s framing in the Instagram post — that these jobs were ""created by (the) president"" — is an exaggeration. Although presidential policy can affect the economy, such as improvement in the fight against the coronavirus partly because of Biden’s policies, many other factors beyond a president’s control can have an effect, too, including the health of the global economy and improvements in technology.Our rulingBiden’s administration said in an Instagram post that he has ""created"" more than double the number of jobs per month, on average, of any president going back to the elder Bush.The chart accurately uses raw numbers, but the comparison is less than meets the eye.The claim relies on less than two years under Biden to either four- or eight-year terms for his predecessors. Economists say this puts Biden at an advantage, because most of his predecessors experienced a recession, which hampered their tenure-long job-creation averages.Meanwhile, using a different metric — percentage increase — Biden ranks third among the last six presidents. And the White House’s use of the word ""created"" in reference to jobs is not entirely warranted, because presidential policies are not the only factor shaping job growth.The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context, so we rate it Half True.",Joe Biden,"October 13, 2022",half-true

Vance and Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan accusing each other of being dishonest.Here, we’ll examine an exchange involving Ryan’s stance on natural gas production. It’s an issue of importance to Ohio, which ranks as the nation’s sixth-biggest producer of natural gas.Vance raised energy policy in the debate’s opening exchange, saying that Democrats have ""gone to war"" against the domestic energy sector. Ryan countered by citing provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed Aug. 16, that Ryan said go ""all in on natural gas.""He continued, ""I’ve been a natural gas proponent since I’ve been in Congress. And we have to get this right. We need to increase our production of natural gas. I support streamlining the permitting process around natural gas so we can get it around the country, lower costs for businesses, and ship it to Europe to stick our finger in Vladimir Putin’s eye.""Vance, however, wasn’t buying Ryan’s claim that he’s championed natural gas production.Vance said, ""Tim Ryan just told a big fib. He said he supported Ohio’s natural gas industry and he’s always done so. And yet Tim Ryan when he ran for president, two years ago, you supported banning fracking both on public lands and generally speaking.""Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, injects water, chemicals and sand at ultrahigh pressure to crack open rock layers and release trapped natural gas.The method has enabled the United States to become a world leader in natural gas production, but it has also caused controversy among environmentalists and local residents’ groups, who argue its chemicals can pollute the environment and seep into water supplies. Environmentalists also worry that fracking can trigger earthquakes.Responding to Vance, Ryan countered, ""You could go back my entire career. We have two natural gas power plants in my congressional district that I helped us get. And the union that works in the natural gas industry endorsed me. Do you think they’re going to endorse me if I’m for banning fracking? It’s just not true.""JD VANCE: ""Tim Ryan just told a big fib.

John Delaney of Maryland, in the early primary state of New Hampshire. During a question-and-answer session, an audience member introduced herself as a participant in a local group that was fighting a pipeline for fracked natural gas.

The amendment did not address permits on nonfederal lands.Vance’s campaign pointed PolitiFact to comments Ryan made to The Washington Post about regulating fracking to prevent environmental damage. ""If the industry cannot rapidly innovate on these issues, I believe the federal government would need to step in and halt fracking operations,"" Ryan said in 2020. Ryan’s broader record shows support for regulated frackingRyan’s statement during the 2019 forum came in response to a question about banning fracking on federal lands only. The questioner did not ask Ryan about the possibility of banning fracking everywhere, and asked only whether he’d ""consider"" the move.The 2017 amendment Ryan supported would have paused fracking on the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf, in sensitive environmental waters off California, thousands of miles from Ohio and any land-based fracking operations there.Ryan’s 2020 comments to the Post were focused on ensuring that local households aren’t hurt by fracking. Ryan told the Post that despite his environmental concerns, fracking ""has provided enormous economic benefits and moved the U.S. towards energy independence.""Ryan also told the Post the industry needed more oversight and regulation, ""especially in regard to its use and disposal of water, as well as methane leaks. ... If the industry cannot rapidly innovate on these issues, I believe the federal government would need to step in and halt fracking operations.""This line of argument — that fracking is economically valuable but needs to be regulated for its environmental risks — is bolstered by legislation Ryan co-sponsored in 2018, the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals, or FRAC, Act. The measure, which did not pass, required disclosure of the chemicals used in fracking fluids and removed the oil and gas industry's exemption from the Safe Drinking Water Act. This would allow the industry to continue operating, but in a more regulated manner. Ryan’s support for it complicates Vance’s argument that he wants to simply ban fracking.Ryan has also spoken favorably about fracking during his Senate campaign. In April 2022, Ryan praised the local natural gas extraction economy in eastern Ohio, which fracking enabled.""This is a hell of an opportunity for eastern Ohio to sell natural gas to Eastern Europe and knock Vladimir Putin’s legs out from under him,"" Ryan said. ""This needs to be a key part of our global strategy, and it’s about jobs, you know, good family wages here, good union jobs here in eastern Ohio. And I’m all for it and I’ll do anything I can to help with this project and any other project we can establish here.""Our rulingVance said that Ryan, ""when he ran for president, two years ago ... supported banning fracking both on public lands and generally speaking.""Ryan said during a 2019 event that he would ""absolutely"" consider banning fracking on federal lands. He also voted to stop the processing of fracking applications for drilling sites off the California coast in environmentally sensitive water. Ryan told The Washington Post that if the fracking industry cannot keep local residents safe, the federal government might need to ""halt"" fracking operations.However, Ryan’s full record of statements and policies on fracking is more nuanced than Vance suggests. Ryan’s focus has been on leveraging natural gas as a transitional fuel and a source of revenue and jobs for Ohio.

And Adam Laxalt called that a ‘historic victory.’ ""He’d let Nevada and other states ban abortion with zero exceptions. He’s not for us.""Laxalt supported the Supreme Court’s June 24 decision that reversed a nearly half-century of precedent guaranteeing the constitutional right to an abortion. Roe’s overturning allowed states to set their own abortion restrictions.But we found no instances in which Laxalt stated support for banning abortion with no exceptions. In Nevada, Laxalt said he would support a referendum that shortened the state’s abortion cutoff to 13 weeks, with exceptions for rape, incest and the mother’s health.Laxalt backed reversing Roe, letting states regulate abortionIn the months since the court overturned Roe, most abortions are banned in at least 13 states, according to tracking by The New York Times. The bans in nine states — Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin — have no exceptions for rape or incest; Mississippi has an exception for rape but not incest. Other states have passed bans with gestational limits of six, 15 or 20 weeks, for example. Most of these measures do allow for one exception: the life or health of the mother.To back its claim about Laxalt supporting ""zero exceptions,"" the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee pointed to Laxalt’s support for overturning Roe and for letting states regulate abortion.In May, Laxalt said in an interview that Roe was ""wrongly decided"" and ""so, for it to be returned to the states is an important process.""In June, before the court’s ruling, Laxalt went further, saying: ""I’m a constitutional conservative lawyer, and Roe v.

He said in the statement, ""The people of Nevada have already voted to make abortion rights legal in our state, and the court’s decision on Roe doesn’t change settled law."" But in a May interview, when a reporter asked Laxalt whether he would support holding a referendum asking Nevada voters to restrict abortion after 13 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions for physical health, rape and incest, Laxalt said he would, according to the article.In August, the Reno Gazette-Journal published an opinion column by Laxalt on his positions on abortion. He said he would support a referendum limiting abortion to pregnancy’s first 13 weeks, but didn’t mention exceptions. He said he would not favor a national abortion ban, because he supports letting states regulate abortion.As for other states, as Nevada’s attorney general, Laxalt filed court briefs in 2018 supporting efforts in Texas and Alabama to ban a procedure commonly used for second-trimester abortions.But we found no Laxalt statements calling for state abortion bans with no exceptions. Our rulingThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee claimed that Laxalt ""would let Nevada and other states ban abortion with zero exceptions.""Laxalt supported Roe v. Wade’s reversal and supports letting states decide what restrictions to put on abortions, which could include laws that ban abortion with no exceptions.

35,Laura Schulte,Says Mandela Barnes “supported a 20% increase in the gas tax.”,"As gasoline prices continue to fluctuate, trending higher after a recent dip, the two candidates running for Wisconsin’s U.S. Senate in November are pointing plenty of fingers. In this case, it is U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., claiming that old policies supported by Democratic challenger Mandela Barnes, the lieutenant governor, would have made gas prices even higher.In a TV ad, Johnson lists off a number of accusations against Barnes, including this one: that Barnes ""supported a 20% increase in the gas tax."" That seems like, well, a lot.So, let’s take a look. Johnson doesn’t consider full gas tax proposalWhen asked about the claim, Alec Zimmerman, Johnson’s communications director, shared a link to a May 2019 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report that described a proposal from Democratic Gov. Tony Evers to increase the gas tax by 8 cents per gallon in order to rebuild and repair more roads. At that time, the gas tax was 32.9 cents per gallon, and would have increased to 40.9 cents per gallon, but the proposal was rejected by the Republican-led Legislature. There is no mention in the story of Barnes, his opinion at the time, or any involvement by Barnes in crafting the proposal — nor did Team Johnson provide any evidence of it. But Barnes was — of course — a member of the Evers administration, and did not so far as we could tell speak out against it. Under the Evers plan, the increase would have been about a 24% jump in the gas tax — not too far off of what Johnson claimed. But the Johnson claim looks at only part of the puzzle. Featured Fact-checkPublic Interest Legal Foundationstated on January 18, 2023 in a reportIn California, there were “10 million mail ballots unaccounted for” in the November midterm election.By Jeff Cercone • January 26, 2023There were many news articles written at the time about the Evers proposal — and Johnson’s team conveniently chose one that touches on the proposal only in passing, and does not get at the details.All of this should be familiar to regular PolitiFact Wisconsin readers: In April, we rated Half True a claim by the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce that Evers ""tried to make us pay even more at the pump by hiking the gas tax."" As we noted in that item, and as was widely reported at the time, the gas tax increase was coupled with a plan to eliminate the minimum markup on motor vehicle fuel, a law that bans selling fuel below cost to attract customers. According to news reports at the time, repealing that measure could have saved drivers as much as 14 cents per gallon. As with the gas tax increase, Republicans rejected eliminating the minimum markup law, even though former Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, once made a similar pitch.To be sure, various looks at the economics behind the minimum markup law showed that, by now, much of that savings would have been eroded by other factors such as inflation.Although the Evers administration — and therefore, presumably, Barnes — did support a jump in the gas tax, it also proposed other measures that would have, at least temporarily, reduced the price at the pump for Wisconsin drivers.That information is ignored by Johnson in making the claim.Our rulingJohnson claims that Barnes ""supported a 20% increase in the gas tax.""Although the Evers administration — and, by association, Barnes — supported an 8-cents-per-gallon increase in 2019, the plan also called for the elimination of the minimum markup on fuel, which had the potential to decrease the price at the pump by 14 cents. Our definition of Half True is a statement that is ""partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.""That’s our rating for this one.",Ron Johnson,"October 6, 2022",half-true

The Senate did not vote on either version. The Equality Act sought to amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act to prohibit discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. The 1964 law  protects against discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin.The bill would have applied to employment, education, housing, credit, jury service and programs receiving federal funding and public accommodations (such as retail stores).Although the majority of states already allow transgender athletes to play in high school and college sports, the bill would have enshrined that right federally.Despite the ad’s claim that Demings voted to teach ""radical gender identity without parental consent,"" the bill did not address school curriculum, legal experts said.Demings’ vote would have allowed transgender student-athletes to competeThe Equality Act did not explicitly address sports, but by prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity, it would have allowed transgender student-athletes in college and high school to compete on teams based on their gender identity rather than their sex asssigned at birth. Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on January 17, 2023 in an Instagram postCNN reported that Damar Hamlin’s doctor confirmed his cardiac arrest was caused by a COVID-19 vaccine booster.By Ciara O'Rourke • January 19, 2023""It would bring the Civil Rights Act into explicit agreement with the Department of Education’s understanding of Title IX to allow transgender students to play sports,"" said Pennsylvania State University law professor Dara Purvis.Title IX is a federal law intended to protect people from sex discrimination in federally funded education programs or activities. If the Equality Act became law, students could challenge state laws that ban or restrict transgender participation in sports, said University of Miami law professor Tamara Lave.Nineteen states have laws banning or restricting transgender participation in sports, The Associated Press reported in June.Equality Act’s connection to curriculum not provenThe Equality Act did not specify anything about teaching gender identity.Rubio’s campaign pointed PolitiFact to an article by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, that speculated that the Equality Act ""could pave the way"" for courts to ""require sexual orientation and gender-identity curricula the same way they required Black history curricula.""University of Virginia law professor Douglas Laycock and Alexis Rangel, policy counsel for the National Center for Transgender Equality, said the Equalilty Act did not address curriculum.The Equality Act deals with ""discrimination and harassment in education, not the content of school curricula,"" said David Farmer, spokesperson for the National Center for Transgender Equality.

37,Liam Halawith,"“Iowans are paying $5,000 extra for everyday goods under Biden and Axne’s inflation.”","Republicans have blamed Democrats a lot for rising inflation this past year. Democrats, after all, are in power at the White House and both chambers in Congress and this is an election year.Thus, Rep. Zach Nunn, R-Bondurant, who is seeking a seat in Congress, brought it up in a recent tweet that introduced a campaign ad that attacks his opponent in Iowa’s 3rd District race, incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Cindy Axne, for out-of-control spending in Washington, D.C.""Iowans are paying $5,000 extra for everyday goods under Biden and Axne’s inflation,"" the tweet stated.We examined a couple of things in that statement: that Iowans will pay an extra $5,000 this year because of inflation and that Biden and Axne can share some of the blame for that inflation. We start with the numbers. Contacted by Politifact Iowa, Nunn’s campaign said they were taken from a March report by Bloomberg News. The report states that by, Bloomberg’s calculations, Americans would pay $5,200 more on average this year for goods using the Personal Consumption Expenditures index. This number is an estimate of inflation throughout 2022 and could be different at the end of the year. Inflation can be measured across other time periods so other measures exist, depending on where you live and from when you measure the rise in consumer good prices. A July report from the Republican side of Congress’ Joint Economic Committee went back to January 2021 — when Biden took office — to state that Iowans were projected to pay $7,997 more this year than they would have for the same goods back then, for a state inflation rate of 13.7% since the start of 2021. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, whose announcements get widespread news coverage, reports Consumer Price Index inflation every month, measuring against the past 12 months. The bureau reported an August rate of 8.1% in the Midwest region for the previous 12 months. That would amount to a yearly increase in costs from August 2021 to August 2022 of $4,176, using the Consumer Price Index report from the Bureau of Labor statistics for the Midwest region. Next, who's to blame. Nunn’s campaign, when contacted by Politifact Iowa, stood by its claim that Democrats are to blame for inflation. The campaign ties Axne to Biden by pointing out accurately, according to the FiveThirtyEight data analysis website, that Axne has voted with Biden 100% of the time during Biden’s term as president. We have looked previously at claims that tie inflation to Biden. Sources in an April 2022 Politifact story said that, although the American Rescue Plan Act, a stimulus package passed in 2021 that cost about $1.9 trillion, added 2 points to inflation, international pressures and supply chain issues had a greater impact on inflation. Featured Fact-checkJoe Bidenstated on January 12, 2023 in remarks at the White House“Take-home pay for workers is going up.”By Louis Jacobson • January 13, 2023Marc Goldwein, with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that promotes lower deficits, said in that PolitiFact story: ""With no American Rescue Plan, we would still have inflation above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2% to 3%.""None of the experts PolitiFact talked with for the April story, liberal or conservative, said Biden’s actions were responsible for all of the inflation. Sources cited in other PolitiFact stories have said that supply chain disruption, low supply of goods and  international market pressures have contributed to inflation. Financial experts in a June New York Times story said strong demand, supply shortages and the aforementioned factors on the service industry also are major pressures on inflation. In a letter to congressional leadership, 126 economists wrote that the Inflation Reduction Act will have a downward pressure on inflation after a short-term upward pressure when the bill was first passed. The letter was obtained first by CNN. Stanford University economist John Taylor and others have said that the Federal Reserve’s fiscal policy during the COVID-19 pandemic could be a factor. That policy aimed to artificially stimulate the economy by keeping interest rates lower than usual. However, the Fed operates on its own, not by Democrats or, when they are in power, Republican partisans.Democrats blame inflation on international pressures such as the war in Ukraine. President Joe Biden said in May blamed inflation on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The war is affecting supply chains but the full impact will not be known for a while. Some countries have higher rates of inflation than the United States, with Turkey having an inflation rate of 54.8%, according to the Pew Research Center. Wendy Edelberg, director of The Hamilton Project and a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said in a Politico story that the supply chain disruption caused by the war in Ukraine is impactful but not the whole story of why inflation is rising internationally. Our rulingNunn’s campaign said Iowans would pay $5,000 more this year because of inflation, and that Democrats were to blame. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that Iowans will pay $4,176 more on household goods this year because of inflation, based on a bureau report for the Midwestern region going back to August 2022. The $5,000 figure comes from an estimate that Bloomberg News analysts predict for 2022. But it is an estimate. We must wait to see how close the prediction was to what happens.The effect the American Rescue Plan ultimately will have on inflation has yet to be determined but it is having some effect, analysts said. But, solely blaming Democrats for inflation does not take into account the whole picture. Supply shortages and strong demand for products, supply chain problems and international market pressures combine with federal monetary policies to affect inflation.

38,Warren Fiske,"“In 2016, Democrats suggested that the election was stolen.”","Gov. Glenn Youngkin recently gave his blessings to an ""Election Integrity Unit"" established by Attorney General Jason Miyares, a fellow Republican, to investigate and prosecute violations of Virginia’s election laws.Youngkin visited Loudoun County’s Office of Elections on Sept. 20 to watch officials test vote-counting machines. Reporters asked him why the 20-person unit is needed when, as Democrats note, Virginia elections have been basically clean.""People have concerns about the election process and oh by the way, it’s not just Republicans; it’s Democrats,"" Youngkin said. ""Let’s just remind ourselves that in 2016 Democrats suggested that the election was stolen.""Did Democrats suggest the 2016 presidential election, won by Donald Trump, was hijacked? The claim is often made by Republicans advancing Trump’s disproven claims that the 2020 presidential election, won by Joe Biden, was stolen by fraudulent vote counting. Youngkin, after some initial hedging, acknowledged last year that Biden was legitimately elected. Youngkin’s office sent us a number of recordings of prominent Democrats saying that Trump’s 2016 victory was turned by events that occurred during the campaign, especially documented Russian interference on Trump’s behalf. It’s important to point out, however, that the Democrats did not question the actual counting of ballots in 2016, as Youngkin’s statement implies, or that Trump won the election.Let’s look at the information Youngkin’s office sent.Hillary ClintonIn 2016, 2.8 million more people voted for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton than Trump, but she lost the determining Electoral College vote. During a September 2019 interview on CBS, she blamed her loss on voting restrictions passed by some states before the 2016 election and Russian hacking of her campaign that was later confirmed by a U.S. Department of Justice investigation.Trump ""knows he’s an illegitimate president,"" Clinton said. ""I believe he understands that the many varying tactics they used, from voter suppression and voter purging to hacking to the false stories — he knows that — there were just a bunch of different reasons why the election turned out like it did … I know he knows this wasn’t on the level.""In an October 2020 interview with The Atlantic, Clinton said, ""There was a widespread understanding that [the 2016] election was not on the level. We still don’t know what happened … but you don’t win by 3 million votes and have all this other shenanigans and stuff going on and not come away with an idea like, ‘Whoa, something’s not right here.’"" Jimmy Carter  In June 2019, Jimmy Carter, the former Democratic president, said, ""There’s no doubt that the Russians did interfere in the election, and I think the interference, although not yet quantified, if fully investigated would show that Trump didn’t actually win the election in 2016. He lost the election, and he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf.""Bernie SandersVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is an independent who has twice sought the Democratic presidential nomination. During an ABC interview in January 2017, he twice declined to say whether he thought Trump would be ""a legitimate president.""""I think he’s going to be inaugurated this week,"" Sanders said.

""I think there was a conspiracy on the part of the Russians and others that helped him get elected. That’s not right. That’s not fair. That’s not the open democratic process.""Jerry NadlerRep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said in January 2017 that Trump was legally elected but an ""illegitimate"" president.""He was legally elected,"" Nadler said. ""But the Russians weighing in on the election, the Russian attempt to hack the election and, frankly, the FBI’s weighing in on the election make his election illegitimate. But he is the president.""Nadler’s reference to the FBI concerned then-FBI Director James Comey’s disclosure to Congress, 11 days before the 2016 election, that he was reopening an investigation into whether emails stored on Clinton’s personal computer contained classified information.Maxine WatersRep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., was among seven House Democrats who raised futile objections to the Electoral College count by Congress in January 2017 that certified Trump’s victory. They tried to argue that the election was tainted by Russian interference and voter suppression. They were overruled because none of their objections had required support from a senator.PollingYoungkin’s office also sent us an April 2022 Rasmussen poll. It showed that 72% of Democrats believe it’s likely the 2016 election outcome was changed by Russian interference, but that opinion is shared by only 30% of Republicans and 39% of voters not affiliated with either major party.Our rulingYoungkin said, ""In 2016, Democrats suggested that the election was stolen."" He was referring to Trump’s victory in the presidential election.Youngkin, a Republican, made the claim while endorsing the formation of an ""Election Integrity Unit"" by Virginia’s attorney general to investigate violations of the state’s election laws. He was at the Loudoun County Office of Elections, where he had just witnessed the testing of vote-counting equipment.Democrats say the integrity unit is an effort to placate disproven Republican claims that Trump’s defeat in the 2020 election was caused by vote-counting fraud. Youngkin, in responding to that accusation, said concern over election fraud is a bipartisan issue.Indeed, some well-known Democrats — including Clinton — said Trump’s 2016 victory was fishy. They mostly cited events that happened during the campaign, such as Russian hacking of campaign information and Comey’s announcement that the FBI was reopening an investigation into Clinton’s emails. They also complained that many states had passed laws that suppressed voter turnout.But Youngkin’s contention that the Democratic response in 2016 equates with the Republican response to 2020 runs into trouble. The Democrats, while questioning events that occurred during the campaign, didn’t contend there was widespread vote-counting fraud that flipped the election. The Democratic leaders cited by Youngkin’s office also made a distinction about 2016 that Trump and his followers did not about 2020. While the Democrats rejected the legitimacy of Trump’s presidency based on the oddities of the campaign, they acknowledged that he won the election.All told, we rate Youngkin’s statement Half True.",Glenn Youngkin,"October 5, 2022",half-true
39,Paul Specht,Ted Budd “helped write legislation to outlaw abortion nationwide with no exceptions for rape or incest — a law that could even put doctors in jail.”,"A new political ad claims that North Carolina’s Republican U.S. Senate candidate helped write a proposal for tighter federal abortion regulations, showing that he’s way out of step with most residents’ opinions on abortion. The ad attacks U.S. Rep. Ted Budd over a bill introduced last year. It praises Democratic candidate Cheri Beasley, who the ad says will stand up for reproductive rights. It was produced by the Women Vote Project, an arm of Emily’s List, a group advocating for women’s issues. The ad says:""Sometimes it feels like we can’t agree on anything, except this: 85% of North Carolinians think abortion should be legal for women who need it. Ted Budd isn’t one of them. He helped write legislation to outlaw abortion nationwide with no exceptions for rape or incest — a law that could even put doctors in jail. There’s a better choice: Cheri Beasley. She’ll always protect our personal freedoms.""The U.S. Supreme Court’s recent decision overturning its landmark Roe v. Wade ruling pushed reproductive rights to the forefront of many campaigns this midterm election season. The decision leaves it up to states to set their own abortion laws.The ad’s claim about North Carolinian’s support for abortion rights is based on a recent poll. But it’s worth noting that PolitiFact analyses of abortion polling have generally found that survey results can vary significantly depending on how pollsters frame and ask questions. Although Budd co-sponsored and supported the anti-abortion bill referenced in this ad, we found its characterization of him as bill author to be an overreach.Bill with ‘no exceptions’The ad says Budd ""helped write legislation to outlaw abortion nationwide with no exceptions for rape or incest,"" and refers to a bill known as H.R. 705, or the ""Heartbeat Protection Act of 2021,"" which was introduced on Feb. 2, 2021. It never became law or even came up for a vote.The bill called for a ban of abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, which typically happens around six weeks — sometimes before women know they’re pregnant. Although the bill carves out an exception if the mother’s life is ""endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself.""The bill doesn’t mention exceptions for rape and incest, as media outlets have noted. The bill also says physicians who perform abortions outside of the bill’s limitations would be fined or ""imprisoned not more than five years, or both."" The ad says Budd ""helped write"" the bill. The Heartbeat Protection Act of 2021 was introduced by U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., and co-sponsored by more than 120 other Republicans. Budd is listed as one of the bill’s 40 original sponsors — a sign that Budd supported the bill before its introduction, said Benjamin Ray, an Emily’s List spokesperson.There’s no formal definition of ""original co-sponsor"" that captures whether or not — or to what extent — a U.S. House member helped write a bill, said Molly Reynolds, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, a research and policy center in Washington, D.C. In other words, just because Budd was an original co-sponsor doesn’t mean he helped write it.Featured Fact-checkTweetsstated on January 24, 2023 in a tweetDiamond and Silk pundit died from COVID-19By Paul Specht • February 6, 2023While Budd’s office may have reviewed the bill before its introduction, PolitiFact North Carolina found no evidence that he ""helped write"" it.A Budd campaign spokesperson didn’t dispute that Budd supported the measure, but said the senate candidate didn’t write it. ""If Ted had written the legislation, I would say Ted wrote the legislation,"" campaign spokesman Jonathan Felts told PolitiFact in an email.Kelly’s office also rebutted the ad’s claim. ""U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly is the lead author of H.R. 705, The Heartbeat Protection Act of 2021,"" Kelly spokesman Matt Knoedler said. ""Mr. Budd is among 123 co-sponsors of the bill, but it was Mr. Kelly and our team who wrote the legislation."" Bills nearly identical to H.R. 705 — also called the Heartbeat Protection Act — were introduced by Rep.

The Life at Conception Act would grant legal protections at the embryonic state, starting at fertilization. The Bloomberg Law article explains how criminalizing abortion could have a dramatic effect on women and people going through fertility treatments to get pregnant, said Ray, the Emily’s List spokesperson. The Women Vote Project announced the launch of its ad Sept. 9. Four days later, Budd was one of more than 120 House members who co-sponsored a bill that would institute a national law banning abortions after 15 weeks. Unlike the bill mentioned in the Emily’s List ad, the proposal would grant exceptions for rape and incest, as well as the life of the mother. The proposal was introduced in the Senate by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. In 2017, he co-sponsored H.R. 586, also known as the Sanctity of Human Life Act, which proposed to define life as ""fertilization, cloning, or its equivalent, at which time every human has all the legal and constitutional attributes and privileges of personhood.""The ad says the bill Budd co-sponsored is out of step with the views of North Carolinians. It cites a poll commissioned by the politically conservative John Locke think tank. The results, released in August, show that 85% of respondents believe that abortion should be totally or mostly legal — or, at the very least, legal in certain cases. The ad bases its claim on that survey alone. Polling experts discourage the use of single surveys to represent a consensus view of an issue. Still, the John Locke results aren’t far off from responses to similar polls, such as one from WGHP-TV, The Hill political website and Emerson College researchers, and one by the Kaiser Family Foundation. This year, Budd was asked whether he supports abortion in cases of rape and incest. He told WNCN-TV: ""I want to look at it broadly. First of all, when a person finds themself in that type of situation, let's just admit right up front, regardless of what your political background is or what party you're with, that it's a tragedy when somebody finds himself there. And I want to say, why would you want to add a second tragedy to an already very tough situation? I don't condemn anybody that's ever been through that.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a member of the party’s progressive wing, voted with Biden about 94% of the time.ProPublica, an investigative news outlet, analyzed major votes by lawmakers and found Ryan voted with Pelosi 100% in the current Congress and the previous Congress. One caveat: Pelosi rarely votes — a tradition among House speakers. That means the comparison between Ryan and Pelosi is based only on the votes in which they both participated. She voted fewer than 80 times during the 116th Congress (2019-21), making it much more likely that she and Ryan (or any Democrat) voted with her.Ryan has disagreed with Democratic leaders on some issues.He is one of dozens of co-sponsors of the Trust in Congress Act that would prevent lawmakers and immediate family members from trading stocks. Pelosi initially said the bill was unnecessary but later said the House could vote on it. The legislation’s sponsors say that Pelosi, whose husband trades individual stocks, has dragged her feet on bringing the bill to a vote.Ryan has also criticized Biden’s plan to eliminate student debt, saying it ""sends the wrong message to the millions of Ohioans without a degree working just as hard to make ends meet."" Ryan’s campaign pointed to multiple votes on trade, agriculture, military or the budget on which he disagreed with Pelosi. Ryan voted for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which passed during a government shutdown, funding the government for several weeks and raising spending limits for two years. Ryan also broke from Pelosi in opposing the USA Freedom Act of 2014, which sought to end the National Security Agency’s bulk phone records collection program. Our rulingThe Vance ad highlights Ryan’s ""love"" for Pelosi and his overlapping voting record with Pelosi and Biden. Ryan’s voting record in the current Congress does align with Biden’s agenda and Pelosi’s recent votes, though as House speaker she does not vote on every measure.But the more glaring issue with the ad is that it snips out Ryan’s explanation of why he thought Pelosi should no longer lead the party. Vance’s ad does not account for Ryan’s notable decision to challenge Pelosi’s leadership after the 2016 election, leaving viewers without the full story. Vance’s statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context.

41,Gabrielle Settles,Martha's Vineyard declared itself as a sanctuary city until the buses arrived.,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ move to fly migrants to Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, generated plenty of criticism. But GOP leaders pushed back with a repeated claim — that the island had already declared itself a sanctuary destination. Peggy Hubbard, a former Illinois candidate for U.S. Senate, expressed the claim on Facebook. ""Martha's Vineyard declared itself as a sanctuary city until the buses arrived,"" she wrote in a Sep. 19 post along with two laughter emojis. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In this case, there’s some basis for the claim that the island has embraced sanctuary policies, but the description could benefit from more context. That’s partly because Martha’s Vineyard isn’t a city; it’s made up of six small towns. We didn’t find evidence that Martha’s Vineyard as a whole has officially embraced sanctuary status. But, in 2017, three towns on the island did — including Edgartown, where the Venezuelan migrants were temporarily housed at St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church.Before getting too far into the weeds, it helps to understand what ""sanctuary"" status really means. Experts told us it’s less a legal term than a political one.The American Immigration Council defines sanctuary policies as those for which ""state and local officials will limit their cooperation with federal immigration officials, but do not actively prevent federal officials from carrying out their immigration enforcement duties.""And the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service has defined a sanctuary jurisdiction as a ""community with a policy, written or unwritten, that discourages local law enforcement from reporting the immigration status of individuals unless it involves investigation of a serious crime.""That aligns with action leaders in Edgartown, Chilmark and Tisbury appear to have taken.Minutes from Edgartown’s 2017 annual town meeting show its board of selectmen unanimously approved an article ""to authorize law enforcement and all town officials to refrain from using town funds and/or resources to enforce federal immigration laws, in keeping with current practice, unless presented with a criminal warrant or other evidence of probable cause, as required by the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.""Also that year, boards for the towns of Tisbury and Chilmark unanimously approved measures that used identical or nearly identical wording.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 18, 2023 in a Facebook postDocument shows that Hunter Biden paid Joe Biden $50,000 a month in rent.By Samantha Putterman • January 19, 2023We reached out to officials in the three remaining communities — Oak Bluffs, West Tisbury and Aquinnah. Town administrators in West Tisbury and Aquinnah told PolitiFact that the town has not adopted sanctuary policies. We didn’t hear back from anyone in Oak Bluffs. And though we searched its meeting minutes, we did not find evidence that Oak Bluffs leaders have approved any measures adopting sanctuary policies. Muzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, explained that a legal definition for ""sanctuary"" doesn’t exist.""It's a catch-all phrase, in popular terminology, to include a bunch of states and cities depending on various levels of their attitudes toward immigrants,"" Chishti said previously. We reached out to Hubbard for evidence behind her claim but didn’t get a response.Martha’s Vineyard residents worked with local and state officials to provide temporary shelter and necessities after the migrants arrived Sept. 14. Two days later, the Venezuelans were offered housing at a military base on nearby Cape Cod. At the time, Gov. Charlie Baker said ""the island communities are not equipped to provide sustainable accommodation, and state officials developed a plan to deliver a comprehensive humanitarian response.""Massachusetts itself is not a sanctuary jurisdiction, although Democrats have tried to pass a bill to change that. In 2017, Massachusetts legislators proposed a bill called the Safe Communities Act, which sought to limit federal immigration enforcement practices throughout the commonwealth. Massachusetts Sen. Julian Cyr and state Rep. Dylan Fernandes, both Democrats who represent the area that includes Martha’s Vineyard, voted in favor of the bill, though the effort ultimately stalled. Since then, Democratic legislators reintroduced the bill, including during this year’s legislative session.The Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors low immigration, lists eight other Massachusetts cities as sanctuaries for immigrants: Amherst, Boston, Cambridge, Chelsea, Concord, Newton, Northampton and Somerville. The towns on Martha’s Vineyard are not named, though it’s not clear why. Our rulingHubbard wrote that """"Martha's Vineyard declared itself as a sanctuary city until the buses arrived.""Martha’s Vineyard is not a city; it’s an island made up of six small towns. At least three of those towns —  Edgartown, Chilsmark and Tisbury — in 2017 adopted sanctuary policies. The migrants stayed temporarily in Edgartown after they arrived on Martha’s Vineyard.

42,Warren Fiske,“Jen Kiggans’ campaign confirmed today that she would support a national abortion ban.”,"Like many Democrats across the nation, U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria, R-Virginia, is trying to make abortion rights the central issue in her hotly contested reelection bid against Republican state Sen. Jen Kiggans. ""After months of lying, Jen Kiggans’ campaign confirmed today that she would support a national abortion ban,"" Luria tweeted on Sept. 14. ""She’s too extreme for Coastal Virginia.""Has Kiggans endorsed a national abortion ban? We fact-checked Luria’s claim and found she has stretched some hazy statements recently made by Kiggans’ campaign.At issue is a bill introduced by U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., that would set a national ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The measure allows exceptions in cases of rape, incest and when continuing a pregnancy would endanger the mother’s life.The bill has almost no chance of passing the Democratic-led House of Representatives this year. And if Republicans win majorities in the House and Senate during this fall’s elections and a similar bill passed next year, President Joe Biden seems certain to veto it.Even so, the bill has stoked already heated debate on abortion following the Supreme Court’s June 24 decision to overturn its 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that established a constitutional right to an abortion. The June ruling empowered states to set their own abortion laws and was praised by Kiggans.Graham’s bill would allow states that have outlawed most abortions, or set restrictions at less than 15 weeks, to keep their laws. The bill would affect states, including Virginia, that allow abortions after 15 weeks. Did Kiggans endorse a national abortion ban?Kiggans has been difficult to pin down on abortion. She said she is ""100%, unapologetically pro-life"" while campaigning in the Republican primary this year but added few details. She modified her language this fall, vaguely saying she supports ""commonsense"" restrictions on abortions.After Democrats pushed Kiggans to take a position on Graham’s bill, Kiggans’ campaign spokesman Bryan Piligra told news outlets, ""The vast majority of Virginians — and Americans — support commonsense restrictions on abortion such as protecting babies from 15 weeks on.""We tried three times to reach Piligra for elaboration, but got no response. Other news outlets were also unable to get more details from the spokesman.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 18, 2023 in a Facebook post“The average American has anywhere from 5 to 15 pounds” of stool stuck in their gut.By Madison Czopek • January 27, 2023Luria’s campaign said Piligra’s statement justified its claim that ""Kiggans’ campaign confirmed … she would support a national abortion ban."" But there are problems with that conclusion.First, Luria’s claim — stated in large letters at the top of her tweet — suggests Kiggans supports an outright abortion ban. Kiggans has not called for that and Graham’s bill would not establish one. Nationally, 95.7% of abortions in 2019 occurred before or during the 15th week of pregnancy, where Graham would set the limit, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Luria does quote a newsletter at the bottom of her tweet, in smaller type, that mentions the 15-week limit.Second, while Kiggans seemed to praise Graham’s bill, she stopped short of endorsing it. The Washington Post said, Kiggans ""called a national ban on abortion after 15 weeks a ‘commonsense’ restriction but did not say whether she would vote for it.""Virginia news outlets recognized this distinction and said that Kiggans ""suggested"" or ""implied"" she would support a 15-week national ban. The news reports also noted Kiggans’ mixed messages on abortion. For example, her seeming openess to Graham’s bill is at odds with her insistence that abortion should be a state matter. Luria is standing by her tweet. ""Jen Kiggans praised a national abortion ban bill when it was introduced and then refused to follow up with reporters when asked for more details on her position,"" Luria campaign spokesman Jayce Genco wrote in an email. ""Women’s reproductive health is on the ballot this November and we will not apologize for responding to the rare statements that she makes on this issue.""Our rulingLuria tweeted, ""Jen Kiggans’ campaign confirmed today that she would support a national abortion ban."" At the bottom of the tweet, Luria noted she was talking about a proposed national abortion ban after 15 weeks of pregnancy.Asked to comment on a proposed 15-week abortion ban, Kiggans’ spokesman said most American ""support commonsense restrictions on abortion such as protecting babies from 15 weeks on."" That clearly suggests Kiggans is open to the idea, but it does not confirm that she supports a ban.

43,Laura Schulte,“Mandela Barnes…wants to release 50% of the prison population when 68% is classified as ‘violent offenders.’”,"Republicans have zeroed in on the record of U.S. Senate candidate Mandela Barnes, a Democrat, as it relates to crime and punishment — or, in one scenario, crime and a lack of punishment.That includes the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the outfit charged with re-electing U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson and other Republicans to the Senate.  In a Sept. 9 news release, the committee claimed that Barnes ""wants to release 50% of the prison population when 68% is classified as ‘violent offenders.’ "" Let’s take a closer look at that claim.The difference between ""release"" and ""reduce"" The first part of the claim brings us to some familiar ground.When we asked the National Republican Senatorial Committee for backup for the claim, they sent a link to a February 2021 Madison365 video, in which Barnes talks about a program he supported during his time in the state Assembly, the 11x15 campaign. The campaign called for reducing Wisconsin’s prison population by 11,000 inmates by 2015. The program fell short of that goal — something Barnes acknowledged in the video. But some of its ideas were embraced by Tony Evers in the 2018 gubernatorial campaign, such as considering early release for some inmates, overhauling truth in sentencing and treating 17-year-olds as juveniles instead of adults. Evers won the state’s top job, with Barnes as his running mate.But looking at the 11x15 campaign, and at the promises that Evers made during the campaign, one word stands out, reduce. That compares to the National Republican Senatorial Committee email, which uses the more inflammatory release.In March 2020, we rated Half True a claim that Evers wanted to release half the prison population. In that item, we noted the definition of the two words at the center of the debate.Reduce is defined by Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary as meaning ""to diminish in size, amount, extent or number.""  Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 26, 2023 in a postThe officers who beat Tyre Nichols targeted him because he was “allegedly dating” one of their wives.By Madison Czopek • February 1, 2023Release is defined as ""to set free from restraint, confinement or servitude."" Meanwhile, in an August 2018 fact-check, we rated Half True a claim by then-Gov. Scott Walker that the plan of his rival, Evers, to reduce the population in Wisconsin jails would release ""thousands of violent felons."" That fact-check noted that release implies a sudden casting open of the prison gates. But Evers had noted repeatedly the drop was a goal and achieving it would take time, through such things as changing sentencing guidelines, increasing funding for treatment-based probation and other policy-related adjustments. The idea was to reduce the number of people being housed in prisons over about a decade without immediately releasing any current inmates. So, in short, the committee misses its mark on this portion of the claim.Violent offensesNow let’s look at the second part of that claim.Kenneth Streit, a clinical professor of law emeritus at the University of Wisconsin Law School, said those considered ""violent offenders"" were convicted of crimes such as homicide, sexual assaults, robbery or aggravated assaults. When asked about how much of Wisconsin’s prison population consists of people sentenced on those types of charges, Streit pointed to data from a 2018 Corrections Department report, the most recent available. In that report, 66% of the state’s prison population consisted of inmates sentenced for a violent offense, 13% sentenced for a property-related offense, 12% for drug-related offenses and 9% for public order offenses, such as operating while impaired. But Streit noted that the majority of those incarcerated for violent offenses have been in jail longer than the other types of crimes, too. ""Violent offenses are actually a much lower percentage of all admissions to prison,"" he said. ""However, they tend to have much, much longer terms and therefore there is little turnover. The other groups have comparatively shorter sentences and, often, they spent a long time in county jail prior to sentencing. Therefore they turnover much more quickly."" Our rulingThe National Republican Senatorial Committee claimed Barnes wants to release 50% of Wisconsin’s prison population, when 68% of inmates are considered ""violent offenders."" Although Barnes has advocated for the ""reduction"" of the state’s prison population, he hasn’t endorsed the immediate ""release"" of 50% of inmates — and there is a key difference in those two words. Reducing the number of inmates would likely require years of policy changes, as opposed to just letting people out of prison, no matter their offense. Meanwhile, the number of people who have been convicted of committing violent offenses is a large portion of the prison population — but largely because other offenses allow for shorter jail times. We rate this statement as Half True — it’s partially accurate, but leaves out some important details or takes something out of context. window.gciAnalyticsUAID = 'PMJS-TEALIUM-COBRAND';window.gciAnalyticsLoadEvents = false;window.gciAnalytics.view({    'event-type': 'pageview',    'content-type': 'interactives',    'content-ssts-section': 'news',    'content-ssts-subsection': 'news:politics',    'content-ssts-topic': 'news:politics:politifactwisconsin',    'content-ssts-subtopic': ' news:politics:politifactwisconsin'});",National Republican Senatorial Committee,"September 21, 2022",half-true
44,Louis Jacobson,"“This year, it's going to be over $1.5 trillion (that we’ve) reduced the debt.""","During a Sept. 18 interview with CBS’ ""60 Minutes,"" President Joe Biden touted his administration’s efforts to rein in federal debt.Biden’s comments came in an exchange with interviewer Scott Pelley, who asked what the president would do to prevent a recession and how he’d expand the nation’s economy. Biden said the economy was already growing, and cited gains in manufacturing jobs. Biden also said he’d work to ""give hardworking people a break,"" pointing to legislation he signed that would allow Medicare to negotiate with drugmakers, which is expected to reduce costs for beneficiaries.Then, Biden turned to the federal deficit and debt. ""We’ve also reduced the debt and reduced the debt by $350 billion my first year,"" Biden said. ""This year, it's going to be over $1.5 trillion (that we’ve) reduced the debt.""Biden has a point that his administration has presided over smaller deficits than were seen under the Trump administration, based on Congressional Budget Office estimates. But Biden’s remark leaves out important context. The debt had risen because of a temporary phase of unusual federal spending. First, a refresher about deficits and debt. The federal deficit is determined by subtracting federal spending from federal revenue, primarily tax collections. If revenue exceeds spending, there’s a surplus; if spending exceeds revenue, there’s a deficit. (There hasn’t been a federal surplus since 2001.)Meanwhile, the national debt amounts to the accumulation of all past deficits, minus any surpluses. The national debt lets the federal government pay for programs and services for Americans even if it does not immediately have the money. This debt lets the government fulfill its constitutional duty, stated in the preamble, to ""provide for the common defense,"" and ""promote the general welfare.""Now, let’s look at the current figures for the deficit and the debt.The Congressional Budget Office’s most recent estimate projects a 2022 deficit of about $944 billion. That’s much less than $2.7 trillion seen the previous year. This decrease of more than $1.7 trillion is in line with the ""over $1.5 trillion"" figure Biden cited in the interview (although, officially, this number is a moving target until the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30).Nevertheless, this figure deserves an asterisk. This year’s projected decline is larger than any previous one-year reduction in the deficit because of an extraordinary historical occurrence: the coronavirus pandemic and the unprecedented government response.During 2020 and 2021, the federal government’s spending skyrocketed as both the Trump and Biden administrations tried to ease the pandemic’s economic blow. Moves included enacting stimulus payments, extending unemployment insurance, instituting business operation grants and increasing public health spending. From 2019 to 2020, federal spending rose by 47%, and then remained at a similar level in 2021, CBO data shows.Featured Fact-checkAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezstated on January 27, 2023 in an interview with reporters“The largest contributor to the debt ceiling, or to our deficit, has been the Trump tax cuts.”By Louis Jacobson • February 1, 2023Because tax revenue didn’t keep pace with spending, the deficit surged in 2020 and 2021. The deficit rose from $983 billion before the pandemic in 2019 to about $3.1 trillion in 2020 and $2.8 trillion in 2021.Vaccines and therapies have cut the risks associated with COVID-19, and the economy has opened up again. Spending programs passed earlier in the pandemic began expiring this year, meaning federal outlays have declined. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonprofit public policy group, has estimated that more than 80% of the $1.7 trillion reduction in the deficit can be explained by expiring or shrinking COVID-19 relief. The White House argued in an exchange with PolitiFact that revenues have also risen because of improvements in the economy.The White House also said the 2022 deficit as a share of GDP is a few tenths of a percentage point lower than it was expected to be before passage of the American Rescue Plan, Biden’s coronavirus and economic relief bill that was enacted in early 2021.In absolute dollars, the current deficit is much more in line with what it was in pre-pandemic 2019.""If the pandemic is over, as the president said in the interview, then it stands to reason that pandemic spending would be down as well,"" said Steve Ellis, president of the nonprofit budget group Taxpayers for Common Sense.The second caveat for Biden’s remark is that the federal debt is not lower today than it had been, but rather that it has not gone up as fast as it would have otherwise.Since Biden was sworn in Jan. 20, 2021, the publicly held federal debt has risen about $2.6 trillion on his watch, to almost $24.3 trillion from $21.6 trillion.Without the reduced deficits Biden referred to, the federal debt would have been higher than $24.3 trillion, probably $1.7 trillion higher, if we use CBO’s estimate.""You can reduce the rate of growth, as is the case here,"" Ellis said, referring to the national debt, but as long as there is a deficit, then there is going to be an increase."" Our rulingBiden said, ""This year, it's going to be over $1.5 trillion (that we’ve) reduced the debt""The latest deficit projection does show the national debt is about $1.7 trillion lower now than it was in 2021.

In 2016, Clinton said she ""never received nor sent any material that was marked classified"" on her private email server while secretary of state. We rated that False. Since then, the State Department and Justice Department have published new information from their own investigations of the emails. Some of Clinton’s emails contained classified information, but none were found to be marked as such. What we know about the markings in Clinton’s emailsClinton’s email troubles started in 2014, when the House Select Committee on Benghazi asked the State Department for all of her emails. The department didn’t have them all because, instead of using only the State Department email system (with an email address ending in @state.gov), Clinton used a personal email address (ending in @clintonemail.com) housed on private servers in her Chappaqua, New York, home.In 2014, Clinton’s lawyers combed through the private server and turned over about 30,000 work-related emails to the State Department and deleted the rest, which Clinton said involved personal matters, such as her daughter’s wedding plans.On July 5, 2016, the FBI released its findings on an investigation into Clinton’s emails. Then-FBI Director James Comey said of the 30,000 emails, 113 were determined to have contained classified information at the time they were sent. Comey said three of those had a marking indicating they were classified, and that 2,000 more were marked as classified after the fact by various agencies.The next day, the State Department explained what the three document markings suggesting classified material were all about. They had to do with what is known as ""call sheets,"" not classified material.Before a secretary of state calls a foreign leader, staff members prepare a guide known as a call sheet. It gives the context for the call and the key points to hit during the conversation. Early in the process, a call sheet might be marked as sensitive, but by the time it reaches the secretary, it isn’t.""The process is then to move the call sheet, to change its markings to unclassified and deliver it to the secretary in a form that he or she can use,"" said then-State Department spokesperson John Kirby July 6, 2016, adding that the confidential markings resulted from human error. In a July 7, 2016, congressional hearing, Comey said he had not heard what the State Department had said about the call sheets. He explained that classified documents come with headers that give the classification level. Comey acknowledged that the documents in Clinton’s email had no headers. Asked whether the lack of a header would have told Clinton that the material was unclassified, Comey said, ""That would be a reasonable inference.""Featured Fact-checkInstagram postsstated on January 11, 2023 in an Instagram post“More contraception availability increases abortion demand.""By Samantha Putterman • January 18, 2023The State Department cited Clinton for three security violations for failing to follow department protocols.

""The senders often refrained from using specific classified facts or terms in emails and worded emails carefully in an attempt to ‘talk around’ classified information.""State Department’s own review of Clinton’s email useThe State Department reviewed thousands of documents in Clinton’s emails, and questioned dozens of State Department employees. The investigation took place primarily during Donald Trump’s presidency, running from July 2016 to September 2019.It focused on the general problem of spillage, the sharing of unmarked but nevertheless classified details. The investigation found 38 people were responsible for 91 violations. It found 497 additional violations in which no one could be held culpable. The State Department concluded that Clinton’s use of a private email server ""carried an increased risk of compromise or inadvertent disclosure."" (The 2018 Justice Department review found no evidence that the server was hacked.) On the other hand, State Department investigators concluded that although staff members sometimes shared information that they shouldn’t have, by and large, they ""were aware of security policies and did their best to implement them in their operations.""They noted that ""none of the emails at issue in this review were marked as classified."" They also said there was ""no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information.""Clinton’s longtime attorney, David Kendall, highlighted the State Department’s findings as evidence for Clinton’s claim. Ambiguities in the classification systemThere is debate over the classification of material in the emails.""There is no one standard for classification,"" Thomas Blanton, the director of the National Security Archive at George Washington University, told PolitiFact in early August.

46,Louis Jacobson,The child tax credit passed under President Joe Biden “has helped 97% of the families with children who are living in poverty.”,"As he hit the road on a campaign bus tour, Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., touted some legislative achievements of President Joe Biden’s administration.""This legislation has helped 97% of the families with children who are living in poverty,"" Warnock said Aug. 29 in Albany, Georgia. ""I'm asking you to stand with me, Albany. Your vote is your voice, and your voice is your human dignity.""It was initially unclear which legislation Warnock was referencing. His campaign later clarified it was the child tax credit that passed in March 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan, a coronavirus and economic relief measure. Warnock’s campaign provided a portion of his prepared text, which makes it clear he’s referring to the child tax credit.The tax credit change was designed to cut child poverty in half. Beneficiaries — who included families with very low incomes and those who are not required to file a tax return — received up to half the credit in monthly payments from July 2021 to December 2021. After that, the provision lapsed. But Warnock jumped the gun by citing the 97% success rate, which was a pre-implementation estimate. Post-implementation studies suggest that the success rate may have been around 75%, partly because of the difficulty of reaching eligible low-income families who may lack bank accounts or may not have known about the expanded credit.Warnock’s campaign told PolitiFact that he was using data from the Congressional Research Service, Congress’ nonpartisan research arm. The agency reported that, depending on income level and race, 83% to 99% percent of families living in or near poverty were estimated to be receiving the child tax credit, with the overall average being 96%.But there’s a catch: The report was issued in July 2021, at the very beginning of the expanded credit’s rollout, and its numbers are projections. Who was helped by the tax credit?Child poverty experts said that although the credits had reached millions of Americans, and very likely a large majority of those households that were eligible, it was misleading to substitute a projection of 97% for the actual disbursement rate.""In the longer term, after a year or two rollout, one might get to Warnock’s numbers,"" Timothy Smeeding, a public affairs and economics professor at the University of Wisconsin and former director of the Institute for Research on Poverty, told PolitiFact. ""If you had a change in family circumstances or were not a regular taxpayer, you had to apply online and hope for the best.

The findings were from the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, and its Well-Being and Basic Needs Survey, a nationally representative survey of adults ages 18 to 64.The Urban Institute also conducted a smaller focus group with 20 low- and moderate-income families closer to the start of the program’s implementation. Although all participants in the focus group knew about the credit, one-fifth of the participants said they had not received a payment.Meanwhile, another study, by the Financial Health Network, found that 20% of respondents who had household incomes under $30,000 reported that they had not received the payment. That would mean a success rate of 80%.Obstacles to receiving paymentAmericans who had previously provided the IRS with their banking information faced the fewest obstacles in receiving payments, especially because pandemic stimulus checks had been routed through those accounts. But some Americans do not have bank accounts that the IRS can access, and that complicated the rollout.Those families ""are likely to be among the lowest income families, disproportionately Black or Latino, and may have a range of family circumstances that pose challenges for outreach and enrollment, including disabilities, insecure housing, lack of internet or phone access, a language other than English spoken at home, and more,"" the Columbia University center wrote.The Urban Institute survey found that other common reasons cited by households not receiving payments were that they didn’t know about the credit; didn’t realize they qualified for it; voluntarily opted out, fearing tax consequences; and government glitches that kept the money from arriving.Our rulingWarnock said the child tax credit passed as part of the American Rescue Plan ""has helped 97% of the families with children who are living in poverty.""Warnock was citing pre-implementation estimates of how many families would benefit, but he framed the 97% success rate as something that had already been accomplished. Post-implementation analyses suggest that the success rate could be closer to 75% or 80%.

Yes, I have a problem with that.— Herschel Walker (@HerschelWalker) August 22, 2022 Walker was referring to the Inflation Reduction Act recently signed by President Joe Biden.He accurately represented the amount of money allocated to support urban tree cover in the Inflation Reduction Act. But his assertion that the effort is being funded by ""raising taxes on those making under"" $200,000 is misleading, since the analysis that drew that conclusion didn’t take into account the savings to Americans from other parts of the bill.When PolitiFact contacted him for this article, Walker said through his campaign, ""Our inner cities need less crime, not more trees.""Shifting sentiment about treesIt wasn’t long ago when a large majority of Republicans indicated they supported tree-planting efforts. A 2020 survey by the Pew Research Center found that 88% of Republicans supported planting about a trillion trees to absorb carbon emissions, which scientists say would help arrest climate change. Also in 2020, President Donald Trump noted in his State of the Union address that he had worked to make sure the U.S. joined the World Economic Forum’s One Trillion Trees planting initiative. And House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., co-sponsored the One Trillion Trees Act along with 33 other House Republicans. (It did not advance.)More recently, though, Republicans and GOP-aligned groups have used trees as a rhetorical punching bag.In August, the group Citizens Against Government Waste ran a Facebook ad that ridiculed spending in the Inflation Reduction Act on such ""wasteful"" efforts as ""‘tree equity,’ ‘clean’ garbage trucks and studying cow farts.""How much will be spent on trees under the new law?The new law allocates $1.5 billion to the U.S. Forest Service’s Urban and Community Forestry program, which averages to $150 million a year over the bill's 10-year life.That’s a substantial cash infusion for the program, which has been funded at around $30 million to $40 million per year for the past few years, said Matt Spitsen, program development manager for the Arbor Day Foundation, which promotes tree planting. Where does funding for the law come from?Walker said the legislation would raise ""taxes on those making under $200k."" But the tax provisions in the measure are aimed at wealthy money managers and big companies.One of the law’s two major tax elements would significantly scale back a tax-code provision known as ""carried interest,"" which allows money managers to pay taxes on much of their income at capital-gains rates, which are lower than the regular rates for personal income.The other provision would require companies reporting at least $1 billion in profits to pay at least 15% in corporate income taxes, which many currently do not do.An analysis by the congressional bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation found the law would raise taxes, on average, in every income bracket. Overall, the federal tax burden for all Americans would rise by an average of 1.4% in 2023, and by less in future years. For those earning between $30,000 and $100,000, the increase would be less than 1% in 2023. But there’s an important caveat: The joint committee analysis looked only at the tax side of the bill, not at spending provisions that could offset those tax increases for most families. The latter includes tax credits for people who buy electric vehicles and implement energy-efficiency improvements; multiyear subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act; and a drug-negotiation provision for Medicare.Featured Fact-checkAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezstated on January 27, 2023 in an interview with reporters“The largest contributor to the debt ceiling, or to our deficit, has been the Trump tax cuts.”By Louis Jacobson • February 1, 2023The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget concluded that the $64 billion in health insurance subsidies alone ""would be more than enough"" to erase the tax increases for people earning less than $400,000 under the Joint Commission on Taxation’s analysis. What will the allocation for trees be spent on?The funding for trees is to be used ""for tree planting and related activities, with a priority for projects that benefit underserved populations and areas,"" according to the bill. Before the bill’s passage, the U.S. Forest Service program’s budget was spent largely on placing staff in every state to support local urban foresters. The new, expanded budget will allow the program to award grants to local nonprofits seeking to improve tree cover in their geographic areas, Spitsen said.The idea is to ""help cities plant more trees in the places where they're needed most,"" said Jad Daley, president and CEO of the advocacy group American Forests.The national program’s focus on racial and economic justice seeks to direct the bill’s funding to neighborhoods that are low-income and relatively treeless. ""Across the nation, on average, the lowest-income neighborhoods in America have 41% less tree cover than the wealthiest neighborhoods,"" Daley said. And neighborhoods where a majority of residents are people of color have 33% less tree cover on average, he said.""Essentially, shade and cooling is distributed according to race and income,"" he said.A jet comes in for approach over downtown Phoenix as temperatures exceed 100 degrees in the morning hours. Phoenix officials are planting thousands of trees to lower temperatures. (AP)Why is the money being allocated?Supporters cite several benefits from expanding tree cover.One major benefit is reducing mortality from heat. Between 1999 and 2010, 8,081 people died in the United States from heat-related deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About three-quarters of those deaths were primarily because of heat, and in the rest, heat was a contributing factor. That’s about five times the number of deaths from hurricanes over the same period, even counting the unusually high death toll from Hurricane Katrina in 2005. And it was about 12 times the number of deaths from tornadoes over the same period.More recent data from a University of Pennsylvania study found even higher numbers for heat-related deaths: an estimated 13,000 to 20,000 between 2008 and 2017.""The allocation of funds to tree planting in cities can have an immense impact on heat risk,"" said Brian Stone Jr., an urban environmental planning and design professor at Georgia Institute of Technology.Stone said his research found that in combination with other strategies, planting trees in Atlanta ""can reduce heat-wave mortality by more than 20%.""Trees also ease carbon levels in the atmosphere. Trees, like all plants, store and immobilize carbon dioxide, which is a key driver of climate change.Daley said it’s estimated that 130 million metric tons per year of carbon dioxide are being stored in trees and forests. ""So it's a really big slice of the natural climate solution,"" he said. Tree-planting is ""a meaningful contribution to actually pull carbon dioxide out of the air.""Finally, trees help save money on cooling. Research published by the U.S. Forest Service suggests that, on average, urban trees and forests help decrease residential electricity use by 7.2% annually. That produces savings in utility costs and also reduces emissions from power generation. Our rulingWalker said, Biden and Warnock ""are spending $1.5 billion on ‘urban forestry’ and raising taxes on those making under $200k to pay for it.""Walker is correct about the amount being spent on efforts to bolster urban tree cover, but he exaggerated when he said the bill will ""raise taxes"" on middle- and lower-income Americans. Analyses that reached that conclusion looked only at the tax provisions in the bill. The spending provisions could offset those increases, or surpass them, by saving Americans money on green improvements, Affordable Care Act premiums and prescription drug costs.We rate his statement Half True.",Herschel Walker,"September 1, 2022",half-true

""But to me, there's a lot going on there that makes no sense. Like get this: 64 members of Congress — Republicans and Democrats — have broken a law to stop insider stock trading, yet Washington refuses to do anything about it."" Beasley, a former North Carolina Supreme Court chief justice, is running for the Senate seat that will soon be vacated by Republican U.S. Sen. Richard Burr. She faces Republican U.S. Rep. Ted Budd in what could be one of the closest Senate races in the nation.Beasley’s claim ""may very technically be true, but it hides a lot of important nuance and distinctions,"" said Robert Walker, a former chief counsel for the Senate and House ethics committees.Most of the congressional members listed in the article Beasley’s ad cites — including U.S. Rep. Kathy Manning, D-N.C.,  — aren’t accused of insider trading. But they’re alleged to have failed to report their stock transactions by a legally mandated deadline. For that, they face fees, not criminal charges. And the soft penalties are one reason Beasley wants to change law, her campaign says.""Cheri is the only candidate in this race who will stand up to both parties and special interests to put North Carolina first, which is why she supports a ban on stock trading by Members of Congress — because our elected officials should focus on serving the people, not enriching themselves,"" said Dory MacMillan, a Beasley campaign spokesperson.About the lawBeasley’s campaign ad cites an article by Business Insider, which is tracking members of Congress who've failed to properly report their financial trades as mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012. Business Insider said it identified 71 members of Congress who didn’t fully comply with the law.That law, known as the STOCK Act, requires members of Congress and others to report their stock transactions within 45 days of the trade, a much stricter deadline than the previous requirement of once a year.Lawmakers face fees if they’re late in filing their periodic transaction reports. The fees start at $200 and escalate depending on how late the reports are filed and how many trades are being disclosed. Lawmakers who face egregious violations or are suspected of trading off insider knowledge are subject to investigation by the House or Senate ethics committees, which govern the reporting.The disclosure reports are public and people can detect potential reporting violations by comparing the listed trade and disclosure dates. However, penalties levied by the ethics committees are not public. So voters, in many cases, are left in the dark about how violations are handled. It’s common for media outlets to report on STOCK Act violations and have no information about legal repercussions for the lawmaker.The fee structure is considered by many to be ineffective. Donald Sherman, a former counsel for the House Ethics Committee, told a congressional committee this year that the fees aren’t high enough to encourage compliance.Still, it’s inaccurate for Beasley to say Washington refuses to do anything. Although the late fees are private, some lawmakers have reported paying them. And a bipartisan push for reforming trade disclosure is credited with prompting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to shift her position in favor of tighter enforcement.About the alleged violationsBeasley’s ad mentions what the STOCK Act is intended to do: prevent lawmakers from using nonpublic information to get an unfair advantage on the stock market. But it leaves out that most lawmakers listed in the Business Insider article aren’t accused of insider trading — but of reporting their trades late. Without that context, the ad implies a level of criminality that doesn’t typically accompany a STOCK Act violation. Some lawmakers featured in the Business Insider article were months late disclosing transactions worth hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. Some are repeat offenders. Very few have been under intense scrutiny. One of them is U.S. Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J. Business Insider reported that Malinowski didn’t disclose dozens of stock trades from 2020 and 2021 until after being questioned by the news outlet, and is now being investigated by the House ethics committee. The Office of Congressional Ethics, a nonpartisan congressional entity charged with investigating misconduct, found that Malinowski hadn’t directed his securities firm to make trades. And, in a statement to PolitiFact, Malinowski’s office said the congressman had already ""gone above and beyond the requirements of the law by placing his life’s savings into a qualified blind trust"" and supports the proposed ban on member stock trading.Featured Fact-checkTweetsstated on January 24, 2023 in a tweetDiamond and Silk pundit died from COVID-19By Paul Specht • February 6, 2023Business Insider and the nonprofit news website Sludge, meanwhile, reported that Manning was late in filing several dozen stock trades that, combined, could be worth up to $1.25 million.

A Whitehouse spokesperson told PolitiFact that Whitehouse’s transactions are made by a manager and that the report was late ""due to a staff transition in the office."" Rep. Ed Perlmutter, D-Colo., was a few days late in disclosing stock trades made by his wife. Perlmutter’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment.""Did they break the law?

Period,"" said Pitt, who is now chief executive of compliance consultancy Kalorama Partners LLC. But there are more serious offenses.""When I see a lot of people in Congress filing late, I see that as sloppy but not necessarily a hanging offense,"" Pitt said.Kedric Payne is a vice president and general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, a campaign ethics watchdog group, and former deputy chief counsel of the Office of Congressional Ethics. Payne said voters — not lawmakers — are often most affected by late disclosures.He compared the cases of Republican U.S. Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky.Burr in 2020 faced a U.S. Justice Department investigation, which has since been closed, after he reported selling up to $1.7 million in stocks just before markets cratered ahead of the COVID-19 outbreak. Burr for weeks faced intense criticism and calls to resign. Burr has denied wrongdoing and said he relied solely on public information.Paul largely avoided backlash after his wife bought stock in a company that makes an antiviral drug used to treat COVID-19 because he disclosed the trades so late. The purchase, made on Feb. 26, 2020, wasn’t disclosed until August 2021. In a statement to PolitiFact, a Paul spokesperson blamed the late report on a transmission error and rejected the notion he benefited from the tardiness of his report. Paul ""completed the reporting form for an investment made by his wife using her own earnings, an investment which she has lost money on,"" Kelsey Cooper, a Paul spokesperson, said. ""This was done in the appropriate reporting time window. In the process of preparing to file his annual financial disclosure for last year, he learned that the form was not transmitted and promptly alerted the filing office and requested their guidance. Dr. Paul attended no hearings public, private, or classified on COVID prior to his wife buying a stock that subsequently lost money.""Paul’s move, intentionally or unintentionally, deprived the public of key information during a time it was most entitled to it.""Voters have a right to know that their elected officials are prioritizing the public interest and not their own personal financial interest,"" Payne said.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)We wondered if either part of the statement was true. First: Yes, on June 29, 2022, the official length of day was 1.59 milliseconds shorter than 24 hours. That’s the fastest the Earth has ever spun since we started keeping track with precision of atomic clocks.However, that’s ""nothing out of the ordinary,"" according to a press release from NASA. According to Wolfgang Dick, a spokesman for the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service, it’s inaccurate to suggest there was anything sudden about this change. ""(T)his fluctuation is quite normal,"" wrote Dick to PolitiFact in an email. The International Earth Rotation and Systems Service, based in Frankfurt, Germany, maintains global time and reference frame standards.Several things can affect the rotation of the Earth and, thus, its spin speed, including a slight wobble of the Earth on its axis, called the Chandler wobble.

According to Forbes, possible reasons that the Earth spun faster in June include seismic activity, changes in the Earth’s core, and polar ice caps melting. Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on January 17, 2023 in an Instagram postGreta Thunberg staged an arrest in Germany.By Ciara O'Rourke • January 19, 2023Second: Are scientists ""gravely concerned?"" We contacted Leonid Zotov, an associate professor at the National Research University Higher School of Economics in Moscow and senior researcher at Sternberg Astronomical Institute, Lomonosov Moscow State University, who recently presented his paper on Earth’s changing rotation. ""The changes in Earth's rotation are quite small, at the level of milliseconds,"" he told us.

There is debate about how much institutions with very large endowments should spend, but some legal requirements dictate how endowment payouts can be used.The numbers Kirk cited are in the ballpark. But his tweet oversells the liquidity and versatility of these endowments. They are not cash reserves that schools can draw on without restriction. The tweet also misleads about taxation — the largest of these endowments have been taxed by the federal government since a 2017 law went into effect, though the institutions themselves opposed it.Some universities have very large endowmentsSome universities, including the ones Kirk listed, have endowments valued at several billion dollars.In 2021, universities reported endowments valued at: $53.2 billion for Harvard University;$42.3 billion for Yale University;$37.8 billion for Stanford University;and $37.7 billion for Princeton University. Kirk’s numbers appear to reflect reported values in 2020, when Yale’s endowment was about  $31.2 billion, Stanford’s was $28.9 billion and Princeton’s was $26.6 billion.Andrew Kolvet, a Kirk spokesperson, said private equity tends to perform better than the stock market, so it’s possible Harvard’s endowment could now exceed $54 billion.Harvard attributed significant endowment returns in 2021 to private and public equity markets. Calling an endowment a ‘hedge fund’ is a misnomerHedge funds pool investors’ money and invest it in an effort to earn a positive return, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  An endowment is a pool of donated funds meant to be invested to maximize returns, but its purpose is more specific: An endowment’s returns are meant to support education at the institution in perpetuity.Each year, endowment investments accrue returns that are used one of two ways. Some are retained in the endowment so it will continue to grow and support the university in the future. Some are used to support the institution’s budget.Featured Fact-checkAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezstated on January 27, 2023 in an interview with reporters“The largest contributor to the debt ceiling, or to our deficit, has been the Trump tax cuts.”By Louis Jacobson • February 1, 2023Universities use endowment distributions to support professorships, financial aid for undergraduates, academic programs, libraries, art museums and other facilities and activities. A percentage of an endowment’s annual payouts are subject to donor-imposed restrictions that require money to support specific programs, departments or purposes. These restrictions limit an institution's ability to access and spend endowment distributions.Endowment funds are often invested in hedge funds to maximize returns, but they are not hedge funds themselves. The National Association of College and University Business Officers’ survey of 720 university endowments found that 17% of endowment funds are invested in hedge funds, on average.Managers of larger nonprofit endowments typically invest in more private equity and venture capital, said Liz Clark, the association’s vice president for policy and research. Larger endowments also allocate more funds to marketable alternatives such as hedge funds, she said. The research shows that institutions with endowments over $1 billion are more likely to allocate a higher proportion of their investments to those marketable alternatives.In 2021, Harvard reported that 33% of its assets were invested in hedge funds, for example. Still, a person who invests in a mutual fund is not a mutual fund. The same is true of endowments, said Sandy Baum, a senior fellow on education data and policy at the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research group.Institutions want to maximize returns on their endowment, ""but the purpose of the endowment is to fund the education of current and future students at the institution,"" Baum said.Endowment investment returns are taxedKirk’s assertion that these funds are not taxed is wrong. Since a 2017 change in law, some private colleges and universities have seen their endowments’ investment return income subjected to a 1.4% excise tax. The tax was part of a Republican-backed tax overhaul signed into law by President Donald Trump. Before that, university endowments were largely untaxed.The excise tax applies to colleges with endowments larger than $500,000 per student. Experts said it is unclear exactly how many universities have been subject to this tax, but a 2018 Urban Institute report said the tax impacts 25 to 30 institutions that together ""enroll fewer than 150,000"" of the nation’s 20 million postsecondary students. In 2022, The Intercept reported that the tax affects over 40 private universities.The Congressional Budget Office estimated the tax would raise $200 million annually, Bloomberg News reported. In 2019, Harvard University faced a $50 million total federal tax bill, with about $37.7 million of that amount stemming from the endowment tax. The university’s operating budget that year was about $5.4 billion.Stanford University said it faced a tax bill of about $43 million for fiscal year 2019 because of the new tax. The school’s operating budget was $6.8 billion.Federal tax revenue goes directly to the U.S. Treasury when collected; most federal spending comes from general Treasury funds, Clark said. Harvard and other wealthy private universities are lobbying for changes to or a repeal of the excise tax, The Intercept and Inside Higher Ed reported. The universities argue that endowments are crucial for funding financial aid programs, and any tax on endowment returns reduces their capacity to support low-income students.Our rulingKirk tweeted, ""Harvard is sitting on top of a $54 billion hedge fund they call an ‘Endowment’ that they pay zero taxes on. Yale has $31 Billion. Stanford $29 Billion.

53,Louis Jacobson,"""Adjusted for inflation, over the last 25 years teachers have made a $29 increase in their salary.""","As students and teachers were heading back to the classroom, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona appeared on NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" to discuss the state of education in the U.S.Cardona expressed regret that teacher pay across the country has not increased significantly over the past quarter century.""Well, if you've heard my interviews, you've heard me say this teacher shortage issue is a symptom of what I call a teacher respect issue,"" Cardona told host Chuck Todd on Aug. 21. ""We need to respect the profession better. College graduates earn 33% more than your average teacher when they leave. And adjusted for inflation, over the last 25 years teachers have made a $29 increase in their salary. That's unacceptable, the fact that we've normalized teachers driving Uber on the weekends to make ends meet or working at a restaurant, waiting tables to make ends meet. We have to lift the profession.""We took a closer look at his statement that ""adjusted for inflation, over the last 25 years teachers have made a $29 increase in their salary.""We found that Cardona left out an important frame of reference: the change in teachers’ weekly salary rates, not their annual salaries. Still, his underlying point, that teacher pay gains have lagged that of other American workers, is solid.Cardona’s office told PolitiFact that he was referring to statistics from the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank. In a report released Aug. 16, the group found that inflation-adjusted average weekly wages of teachers had increased by just $29 between 1996 and 2021, specifically from $1,319 to $1,348 in inflation-adjusted dollars. Over 52 weeks, that is an increase of $1,508 above inflation over that 25-year period. Teachers are often paid on a school-year basis, so their actual earnings increase in a given year may have been less than that. Sylvia Allegretto, the author of the EPI paper, told PolitiFact that there is not a significant difference in the data between hourly and annual wages; both tell a similar story. ""What is important is the growing (shortfall in) teacher pay results, regardless"" of the method used to measure it, she said.To calculate these figures, the group used two detailed data sets from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We decided to see if the data from Cardona’s own department tracked with the Economic Policy Institute’s. So we examined National Center for Education Statistics’ data to find the estimated average annual salary of teachers in public elementary and secondary schools.Those numbers are just a little different. Between the 1995-96 school year and the 2020-21 school year, average annual K-12 teacher salaries in public schools rose from $64,113 to $65,090. That’s an increase of $977 after accounting for inflation. (The Economic Policy Institute and Education Department tracked salaries of teachers via only average income, not the median.  Allegretto said that either measure would be acceptable for studying teacher pay; unlike some fields where extreme outliers can skew averages compared to medians, the range of salaries in K-12 teaching is fairly compact.)Featured Fact-checkMarjorie Taylor Greenestated on February 1, 2023 in a House committee hearingIllinois “received $5.1 billion at an elementary school there that used it for equity and diversity.”By Jeff Cercone • February 3, 2023!function(e,i,n,s){var t=""InfogramEmbeds"",d=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(""script"");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,""infogram-async""); That wage-scale gain trailed those experienced by full-time workers as a whole.Between the third quarter of 1995 and the second quarter of 2022, the median weekly earnings for full-time workers age 16 and up rose from $313 to $358, when adjusted for inflation, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.That’s an increase in weekly income of $45, which works out to $2,340 on an annual basis, or more than one and a half times the rate of increase for teachers.!function(e,i,n,s){var t=""InfogramEmbeds"",d=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(""script"");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,""infogram-async""); Meanwhile, the increases for workers with a bachelor’s degree or higher — which is a category that most teachers would fall into — increased even more rapidly.Statistics from the Education Department show that workers with a bachelor’s degree or higher had median annual earnings of $50,480 in 1995 and $54,102 in 2020 (using 1995 dollars to adjust for inflation). That’s an increase of more than $3,622 over the same period, or a rate of increase much higher than for teachers.Over a 25-year period, even the more generous estimate for teachers’s wage gains — $1,508 — works out to just a $60 pay increase above inflation every year, on average.For holders of bachelor’s degrees or higher, the increase per year above inflation was about $145.Our rulingCardona said, ""Adjusted for inflation, over the last 25 years teachers have made a $29 increase in their salary.""While a listener may assume that this means a $29 increase over the course of the year, this is actually $29 over the course of a week.

Tony Evers, a Democrat.Evers, meanwhile, has been tuning up a message framed around an area typically associated with Republicans: Business.""We are number one in the country as far as our spending money on businesses as it relates to the percentage of federal funds that we receive,"" Evers told Charles Benson of WTMJ-TV, Channel 4, in a July 24, 2022, interview.Evers made a similar claim in his February 2022 State of the State Address:""I’m proud to report that, as a share of the federal aid our state has received, Wisconsin ranked second in the country for aid we’ve directed to economic development, and we ranked first in the country in aid we’ve allocated to businesses."" Evers is talking, of course, about COVID relief funding that came to the state – money that, notably, was up to Evers alone (not the GOP-controlled Legislature) to distribute.Does Wisconsin really rank first in money allocated to businesses, when measured as a percentage of federal funds received?Let’s take a look.A ranking with a few asterisksWhen asked to back up Evers’ claim, spokesperson Britt Cudaback cited figures from the Washington, D.C.-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think tank that analyzes the impact of federal and state government budget policies. Those figures focused on the American Rescue Plan Act (known as ARPA), a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus bill signed into law by President Joe Biden on March 11, 2021, to help the U.S. recover from the economic fallout and health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. But that’s only one COVID-related stimulus plan, a point we’ll come back to later.According to the center’s data spelling out ARPA allocations through March 2022, of the $2.5 billion given to Wisconsin, some 80.3% has been allocated.Here are the top five states, by percentage of money used as assistance to businesses – and, in parentheses, the total allocated to businesses. Wisconsin: 31.56% ($641 million)  Maine: 18.69% ($186 million) Rhode Island: 17.23% ($20.5 million)North Carolina: 11.66% ($630 million)Featured Fact-checkRon DeSantisstated on January 17, 2023 in a press conference""Almost every study now has said with these new boosters, you're more likely to get infected with the bivalent booster.""By Yacob Reyes • January 20, 2023Illinois: 11.46% ($323 million)That’s consistent with how Evers said he would spend the money. He noted in a March 29, 2021, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article that at least $600 million would go to Wisconsin businesses. Looking at the the group’s map of the U.S., PolitiFact Wisconsin counted 24 states — including Oregon, Montana, New Mexico and Florida — with no assistance listed for businesses in that period.To be sure, if you include territories, Wisconsin is not at the very top. Wesley Tharpe, the organization’s deputy director of state policy research, considers the characterization by Evers ""somewhat imprecise"" because ""technically Guam has allocated the highest share to business assistance of funds received so far (56.9%).""That said, people generally understand a comparison such as that by Evers to be among the 50 states.Tharpe also noted that the percentages are based only on money allocated as of March 2022, ""so there’s no guarantee that that ranking will hold once the remaining dollars go out.""So, those are a couple modest caveats about the data.Here’s another one: The group’s analysis covers only ARPA money.Before ARPA, there was the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (known as CARES), a bipartisan $2 trillion package signed in March 2020 by then-President Donald Trump. The state got some $2 billion through that package. But the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has not done a comparable state-by state analysis of the CARES Act — and Evers’ own staff said it is unaware of any analysis that takes a comprehensive look at the combined COVID-related grant money.The National Conference of State Legislatures created a database that looks more broadly at COVID relief money and what the various states did with it. But as it is structured, state-to-state comparisons are difficult — and Cudaback, Evers’ spokesperson, acknowledged gaps in that information and that the two groups may collect and categorize the information differently. She also argued that the programs Evers was talking about at the time of the claim were related to spending specifically for ARPA funds, so the factors ""suggest the governor was referring specifically to ARPA investments.""Our rulingEvers said ""We are number one in the country as far as our spending (COVID relief) money on businesses as it relates to the percentage of federal funds that we receive."" Based on the available information, the claim appears to be on target, with a few caveats.

""Then they funded his campaign.""Cortez Masto made essentially the same claim about Laxalt and the oil industry in a TV ad. A different TV ad, by a super PAC affiliated with the League of Conservation Voters, also targeted Laxalt’s ties to the oil industry. As attorney general in 2016, Laxalt opposed investigations of the oil industry in other states.When Laxalt ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2018, a super PAC largely funded by oil interests did not contribute directly to his campaign, but said it spent $2.5 million on ads to support his run.Climate change investigations Cortez Masto’s Snapchat ad, scheduled to run June 17 to Aug. 23, cited a news story about Laxalt’s efforts as attorney general in 2016 to block an investigation of Exxon Mobil’s alleged role in downplaying climate change.

But $3.88 million was from individuals in that industry; the rest was from organizations. The next-largest donor group by industry, as defined by OpenSecrets, were retirees, at $2.69 million; and electronics and manufacturing equipment, at $2 million.The largest donor during the cycle was the Charles G.

56,Julie Appleby,"About a federal hospital price transparency requirement, “Nobody’s enforcing that law.”","Rapper Fat Joe takes on hospital industry executives in an advertisement, contending that many hospitals are disobeying a law that requires them to publicly post the prices they charge cash-paying patients and insurance companies for every service they offer.The ad, paid for by Power to the Patients, a nonprofit group, states, correctly, that hospitals must list their negotiated prices and asserts that the rule helps patients by making it harder for them to be overcharged. The ad also blames politicians and regulators because the price information is still not necessarily available.""Nobody’s enforcing that law,"" Joe alleges in the foreboding commercial, which began running on television and social media in April and is still airing.The ad reflects a desire for accountability as policymakers increasingly view price transparency as a tool to lower health care costs. And because the law requiring the posting of prices went into effect more than a year ago, we decided to take a look: Is anyone enforcing it?Turns out there is some enforcement, although the process is more complicated and slower-moving than some observers would like.Some background on transparencyUnder rules that took effect in January 2021, the nation’s more than 6,000 hospitals must post online the rates they’ve negotiated with every insurer for every service, from appendectomies to X-rays, and the prices they charge cash-paying patients.The requirement, which the hospital industry unsuccessfully went to court to stop, stems from the Affordable Care Act and an executive order from the Trump administration. Failure to post the required price information can result in fines of $300 a day, recently increased by the Biden administration to as much as $5,500 a day for the largest hospitals.The idea behind the rule is that consumers, including employers who pay a large chunk of the health insurance bills in the U.S., can use the information to shop for less expensive hospital care, which, in turn, might slow spending or reduce prices. At a minimum, the thinking goes, it will help patients know what to expect. In July, even broader rules went into effect for health insurers, which must post almost all the prices they’ve negotiated — not only with hospitals but also with every other kind of medical facility they contract with, as well as doctors.Hospitals have dragged their feet, and compliance is spotty. Studies have found that many hospitals have posted at least some data but that large shares of the facilities have failed to post everything required.What about Power to the Patients?The website of Power to the Patients, which is behind the ad and a broader campaign about health care costs, refers questions to an associated organization, Patient Rights Advocate. It is a nonprofit started by businessperson Cynthia Fisher, who founded two companies and serves on the board of the Boston Beer Co. Fisher saidshe is also the primary funder of Power to the Patients, which she described as a communications organization that has applied to the IRS for nonprofit charity status.In an interview, she cited no specific sources for the claim that no one is enforcing the law, but Patient Rights Advocate has released two related reports, the most recent of which said only 14.3% of 1,000 hospitals it reviewed had posted all the prices the law requires.She praised the Trump and Biden administrations for focusing on price transparency, but she said the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services had not evaluated enough hospitals or moved fast enough to sanction those that have not complied.What about enforcement?When the ads began running in April, 15 months after the requirement went into effect, regulators had not fined any hospitals.In early June, CMS issued penalty fines of about $1.1 million against two Georgia hospitals — Northside Hospital Atlanta and Northside Hospital Cherokee, both of which are part of the Georgia Northside Hospital System — that are owned by the same company. Those were the first fines issued under the new rules.As of late July, the agency had sent 368 warning notices to hospitals and issued 188 corrective action plan requests to hospitals that had previously received warning notices but had not yet corrected deficiencies, according to a statement from Dr. Meena Seshamani, deputy administrator and director of the Center for Medicare.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 18, 2023 in a Facebook post“The average American has anywhere from 5 to 15 pounds” of stool stuck in their gut.By Madison Czopek • January 27, 2023""CMS is actively enforcing these rules to ensure people know what a hospital charges for items and services,"" Seshamani said in the statement.But enforcement is neither a quick nor an easy proposition. Each step in the process gives both sides time to work out the details, said Ariel Levin, director of coverage policy at the American Hospital Association.The first step is the warning letter, which outlines the suspected violation, such as not having an accessible file on the website or not including negotiated prices or cash rates.Hospitals have 90 days to respond. For example, Levin said, a hospital might explain that its files have some blank spots because it has not negotiated rates for a particular service with a particular insurer.""If CMS deems the response appropriate, the case is closed,"" she said. ""If CMS wants more information or doesn’t think it’s right, that’s when the corrective action plan comes in.""Fines are usually the last step.The nearly year and a half that went by before the first fines were issued wasn’t that long, Levin said, considering that both hospitals and regulators needed to learn what the files should contain, that hospitals were given time to resolve technology problems and challenges related to posting the pricing information, and that hospitals were stretched thin because of the COVID-19 pandemic.Still, the lag triggered impatience.""Some stakeholders have been frustrated by the slow pace of the enforcement,"" said Katie Keith, director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at Georgetown University Law Center.Even so, ""I don’t think it’s fair to say no one is enforcing"" the law, Keith said. CMS has ""issued monetary penalties against the two hospitals in Georgia, which they don’t do very often, and there have been hundreds of warning letters notifying hospitals that they have to fulfill their obligations.""Warning letters are a good step but ""need to be followed with meaningful enforcement,"" said Elizabeth Mitchell, president and CEO of the Purchaser Business Group on Health, which represents large employers that offer health insurance and has long sought more easily accessible price information.And with more than 300 warning letters issued, Mitchell expects ""there will likely be additional fines because we’re not seeing a readiness to comply.""Does price transparency matter?Power to the Patients has thrown its resources into the campaign — Fisher said the ad ""cost millions,"" for instance — because they expect price data to unleash more competition in health care. Consumers will ""have choice, save money, and make their own health decisions based upon knowing prices,"" Fisher said.But that’s not a given, say policy experts, noting that price data alone may not sway patients, who often seek care from providers their doctors recommend and mostly don’t use the shopping tools already available. And until the enormous data files from the hospitals and, more recently, the insurers go from simply being publicly available to being accessible in consumer-friendly formats, they will be difficult for the average patient to use, Keith and other experts said.""This idea that it will unleash a consumer revolution has not yet come to pass,"" Keith said.Our rulingHospitals have taken their time in posting the required price information. Many still need to provide some, or all, of what is required. And enforcement has proved to be time-intensive and bureaucratic.However, the transparency directive is a first-of-its-kind rule, so a learning curve was to be expected, for both hospitals and regulators, as they determined the types of data required and the format in which to post the information.Although it is correct to say that the enforcement has been slow and spotty, experts maintain that ramping it up takes time. And when the ad first aired this spring, enforcement was especially lackluster. However, the ad continues to run unaltered, even as enforcement efforts have started to gain steam.

The tax provisions are aimed at wealthy money managers and big companies.One of the two big tax elements would significantly scale back a tax code provision known as ""carried interest,"" which lets money managers pay taxes on much of their income at capital-gains rates, which are lower than the regular rates for personal income.The other provision would make it harder for companies reporting at least $1 billion in profits to escape corporate income taxes. Such companies would have to pay at least 15% in such taxes, which many currently do not.On the spending side, the bill would offer a mix of programs to curb climate change. It is far more limited than the Green New Deal, a climate-change policy blueprint supported by progressive Democrats that never advanced in either chamber of Congress.The bill would also allow Medicare for the first time to negotiate prices with drugmakers and extend for three years certain subsidies to Americans who get their health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The bill would also allocate additional funding to the Internal Revenue Service to improve tax compliance; this provision is expected to bring back to the Treasury an amount greater than the added spending. Here are some aspects of the bill that Laxalt and others didn’t mention.The taxation analysis looks at only part of the billThe critics have a point in saying that the Joint Committee on Taxation analysis found higher taxes, on average, in every income bracket. Overall, the federal tax burden for all Americans would rise by 1.4%. For those earning between $30,000 and $100,000, the increase would be less than 1%; for those earning less or more, the increase would exceed 1%. (An individual household’s tax burden may go up or down; the 1.4% figure is an average.)""I think it is fair to say this tax plan impacts these households,"" said Kyle Pomerleau, a tax specialist at the American Enterprise Institute.But there’s an important caveat: The joint committee looked only at the tax side of the bill, not at spending provisions that could cancel out those tax increases.Featured Fact-checkAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezstated on January 27, 2023 in an interview with reporters“The largest contributor to the debt ceiling, or to our deficit, has been the Trump tax cuts.”By Louis Jacobson • February 1, 2023The study ""is informative but not comprehensive,"" wrote the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that favors deficit reduction and has been skeptical of many of Biden’s legislative efforts, citing their cost. ""In particular, it’s important to note that the (bill) does not raise taxes on those making less than $400,000 per year. It will indirectly affect those households in a number of ways, but even then, the net effect is likely to be to increase their real disposable income.""For instance, the bill’s climate provisions would offer tax credits to people who buy electric vehicles and implement energy-efficiency improvements, and to companies that make renewable energy equipment.Of even greater importance to Americans on the lower end of the income spectrum are subsidies for insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The subsidies would be extended for three years rather than ending by the close of this year.Also important for a broad range of Americans would be the drug-negotiation provision for Medicare, although the impact might take longer to land than for the other provisions.""Before relitigating the debate over President Biden’s pledge not to raise taxes on households making less than $400,000 a year, it’s worth keeping these missing pieces in mind,"" wrote William G. Gale and John Buhl for the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget concluded that the $64 billion in health insurance subsidies alone ""would be more than enough"" to erase the tax increases for people earning less than $400,000 under the Joint Commission on Taxation’s analysis. The group said the bill overall would provide a net tax cut starting in 2027, once higher tax compliance and lower drug costs begin to make a significant impact.The tax increases in the bill are not directThe bill’s effects on average taxpayers will not be felt in the same way as income and payroll taxes. Rather, the rise in tax burdens stems from the increase in corporate taxes. Corporations tend to pass the cost of these tax increases to regular people through lower returns for investors and lower wages for workers.The Tax Policy Center and other groups that study tax policy use mathematical models to project how changes in the tax code, including corporate taxes, would affect taxpayers of varying income levels. In the Tax Policy Center’s model, 80% of the corporate tax increase would be borne by corporate shareholders. The remaining 20% would be borne by workers through reduced wages. This is close to the breakdowns used by the Joint Committee on Taxation.Some households could be hit by both impacts. For instance, members of a household might see lower returns on the stock investments in their 401(k) retirement plans and lower wages.But because these effects don’t show up on a person’s tax returns or receipts for gasoline, some experts say it’s unfair to call them a ""tax hike.""Five former Treasury secretaries — Hank Paulson (who served under President George W. Bush), Robert Rubin and Larry Summers (who served under President Bill Clinton), and Tim Geithner and Jacob Lew (who served under President Barack Obama) — signed a statement in which they supported the bill and rejected the argument that its provisions represent a tax increase.""Taxes due or paid will not increase for any family making less than $400,000 a year,"" they wrote. ""And the extra taxes levied on corporations do not reflect increases in the corporate tax rate, but rather the reclaiming of revenue lost to tax avoidance and provisions benefitting the most affluent.""Our rulingLaxalt said the Democratic bill would ""increase taxes on millions of Americans across every income bracket.""An analysis by Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation did find that every income group would lose ground from the bill’s tax changes — approximately 1%.However, this analysis didn’t factor in the ways ordinary Americans would gain from the bill, including subsidies for energy efficiency and clean energy, the continuation of expiring subsidies under the Affordable Care Act and lower drug prices because of Medicare negotiations. Independent experts expect these benefits to cancel out, or reverse, the bill’s tax impacts.Characterizing the bill as a blanket tax hike obscures how the prescribed taxes would be levied directly on very large corporations and high-earning money managers. The impact on ordinary Americans comes from difficult-to-measure secondary effects.The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",Adam Laxalt,"August 3, 2022",half-true

(They do not qualify for in-state tuition.)But this reduced out-of-state tuition is unsubsidized, meaning taxpayers do not pay for it. Also, the discounted rate isn’t available only to immigrants illegally in the country. U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents are also eligible if they meet the specified requirements.How tuition criteria has changed over the yearsIn-state tuition for Arizona students in the U.S. illegally has undergone years of legal challenges.A 2006 Arizona ballot initiative, Proposition 300, prohibited in-state tuition for students in the U.S. illegally. However, in 2012 the Obama administration created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which prevents the deportation of immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally as children.As a result, the Maricopa County Community College District began offering eligible DACA students in-state tuition, by accepting their employment authorization as evidence of residency. In 2013, then-Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne sued Maricopa Community College District over this decision, saying it violated Proposition 300.A Maricopa County Superior Court in 2015 ruled that extending in-state tuition to DACA recipients was not illegal. That same year, the Arizona Board of Regents voted to allow in-state tuition for eligible DACA students. Robson was not on the board at the time. In June 2017, the Arizona Court of Appeals struck down the lower court ruling, saying DACA beneficiaries were not eligible for in-state tuition. Maricopa Community Colleges appealed the decision to the Arizona Supreme Court.That same month, on one of Robson’s first days on the Arizona Board of Regents, the board voted 7-1 to continue providing in-state tuition for DACA students while the case was under litigation. Robson supported the measure.Featured Fact-checkPublic Interest Legal Foundationstated on January 18, 2023 in a reportIn California, there were “10 million mail ballots unaccounted for” in the November midterm election.By Jeff Cercone • January 26, 2023In 2018, the Arizona Supreme Court agreed with the appeals court and ruled that DACA students were ineligible for in-state tuition.In response, the Board of Regents prohibited in-state tuition for DACA students, but turned to a 2015 board rule that allowed it to provide lower tuition costs for Arizona’s DACA recipients. That rule created an unsubsidized ""high-school graduate nonresident tuition rate,"" of 150% of in-state tuition for students who were ineligible for in-state tuition but met a set of criteria.The rate became an option for students who met all three requirements below:Attended an Arizona high school for at least three years;Graduated from an Arizona high school; andWere ""lawfully present"" in Arizona. (DACA recipients are considered to be ""lawfully present;"" that’s not the same as having legal status.)In 2019, the board unanimously voted to amend the 2015 policy so that all students who live illegally in Arizona, not just DACA recipients, are also eligible for the reduced nonresident rate. Currently, in-state tuition at Arizona State University, one of the three public universities the board oversees, is about $13,000 a year. Nonresident tuition is around $19,000 a year, and the out-of-state tuition cost is $32,000 a year.In 2021, the board, in a symbolic vote, affirmed its support for legislation that makes DACA recipients and other Arizona high school graduates eligible for in-state tuition. This vote did not change any policies.In November, Arizonans will vote on a measure seeking a partial repeal of Proposition 300. Arizona taxpayers do not pay for the nonresident tuition rateLake’s ad misleads voters by claiming that Robson’s votes placed the tuition costs on taxpayers.A student who is eligible for the reduced tuition rate is responsible for paying it. Students in the U.S. illegally are ineligible for federal financial aid, and in Arizona, because of Proposition 300, they are also ineligible for state-funded financial aid. These students rely on their own money and private assistance to pay for college.Arizona spends less than most states on higher education, according to data from the Urban Institute. A large part of Arizona’s higher education funding comes from tuition payments, not taxpayer dollars. All students who graduate from an Arizona high school, regardless of their immigration status, are eligible for the discounted out-of-state tuition rate if they meet all required criteria.Our rulingLake claimed that Robson ""gave illegals tuition discounts and made us pay for it.""While on the Board of Regents, Robson voted to allow DACA students to continue paying in-state tuition while a case over their eligibility for this rate was resolved in the courts.

59,Louis Jacobson,"""We've cut the deficit by a record $1.5 trillion this year.""","Facing four-decade-high inflation and a declining stock market, the Biden administration has tried to tout some positive signs for the economy.Often, administration officials cite today’s historically low unemployment rate. On occasion, they’ve touted progress on reducing the federal deficit. During an appearance on NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said, ""We've cut the deficit by a record $1.5 trillion this year.""Yellen has a point on the scale of the reduction, but it’s important to put this decline into the context of the coronavirus pandemic, which jolted the federal government’s fiscal picture and helped produce the large deficit decline Yellen is touting.First, a refresher about deficits. The federal deficit is determined by subtracting federal spending from federal revenue, primarily tax collections. If revenue exceeds spending, there’s a surplus. If spending exceeds revenue, there’s a deficit. (There hasn’t been a federal surplus since 2001.)The Congressional Budget Office’s most recent estimate of the 2022 federal budget projects a deficit of about $1.04 trillion. That may sound like a lot of money to be in the hole. But it’s a lot smaller than the federal government deficit was during the previous year: $2.78 trillion.That’s a difference of roughly $1.7 trillion. That is slightly more than what Yellen said. However, there are a variety of ways to measure income and spending, and all these numbers are moving targets until the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.The bigger problem factually is Yellen’s characterization of the deficit reduction as a ""record."" This year’s projected decline is larger than any previous one-year reduction in the deficit, but that’s because of an extraordinary historical occurrence: the coronavirus pandemic, and the unprecedented government response.During 2020 and 2021, the federal government’s spending skyrocketed as both the Trump and Biden administrations tried to ease the pandemic’s economic blow. Moves included enacting stimulus payments, extending unemployment insurance, instituting business operation grants and increasing public health spending. From 2019 to 2020 alone, federal spending rose by 47%, and then remained at a similar level in 2021, CBO data shows.Because tax revenue didn’t keep pace with spending, the deficit surged in 2020 and 2021. The deficit rose from $983 billion before the pandemic in 2019 to about $3.1 trillion in 2020 and $2.8 trillion in 2021.!function(e,i,n,s){var t=""InfogramEmbeds"",d=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(""script"");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,""infogram-async""); Featured Fact-checkAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezstated on January 27, 2023 in an interview with reporters“The largest contributor to the debt ceiling, or to our deficit, has been the Trump tax cuts.”By Louis Jacobson • February 1, 2023The coronavirus pandemic isn’t over yet, but vaccines and therapies have cut the risks associated with it, and the economy has opened up again. As a result, spending programs passed earlier in the pandemic began expiring this year, meaning federal outlays have declined.This phenomenon — the passing of a temporarily expensive phase for the federal government —  caused the record amount of deficit reduction.Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group tracking the federal budget, said that although the spending on the public health emergency is understandable — much of it set in motion by Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump — it’s important to note the unusual circumstances of the decline.""While I welcome deficit reduction, the $1.5 trillion was off of enormous deficits,"" Ellis said. ""It lacks a certain context.""Indeed, the deficit projected for 2022, just over $1 trillion, is a bit larger, but roughly in line with the deficit from 2019, the last prepandemic year, which was just under $1 trillion. So someone could just as easily say that the Biden administration has overseen a return to normalcy in budget deficits rather than set new records for deficit reduction.The Treasury Department told PolitiFact that the expiration of pandemic spending programs, rather than their continuation, stems from policy successes by the Biden administration, so it’s not unreasonable to give the administration some credit for enabling that reduction.""The end of COVID relief spending is no accident and instead the direct result of the administration’s vaccination and COVID strategy,"" the department said in a statement. Such improvements were ""not automatic. In fact, there is plenty of evidence that distribution of the vaccine pre-Biden was riddled with problems.""Still, it’s important to note that the ""record"" deficit reduction is not an apples-to-apples historical comparison. The reduction followed an extraordinary period of high federal spending amid a global pandemic unseen in at least a century.Our rulingYellen said, ""We've cut the deficit by a record $1.5 trillion this year.""The final figure remains to be seen, but projections range from $1.5 trillion to $1.7 trillion, which is in the ballpark.However, declaring this a record sidesteps the highly unusual circumstances that made it possible — the expiration of spending measures to combat the pandemic.

As the figures are shown, words on the screen refer to ""Warnock’s spending bill"" and ""Cortez Masto’s spending bill."" To back its statement, One Nation pointed us to analyses by the Brookings Institution think tank and a statement from Senate Democrats. Spokespeople for the senators pointed out that leisure projects were not in the legislation.Both senators voted for a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, the American Rescue Plan, which passed 50-49 along party lines. President Joe Biden signed it into law in March 2021. The bill did not itemize the three expenditures highlighted in the ad; rather, it included $350 billion that could be spent by state and local governments, which is how each of these three projects were funded. The three projects could be called ""leisure,"" but local officials said they were intended to revive tourism once the pandemic was over.The group and the racesThe ads target Nov. 8 races that campaign watchers rate as toss-ups. Their outcomes could decide which party controls the Senate, which is split 50-50. The Republican challengers, Herschel Walker in Georgia and Adam Laxalt in Nevada, are endorsed by former President Donald Trump. One Nation is a nonprofit that shares resources with the Senate Leadership Fund, McConnell’s super PAC. One Nation is a so-called dark-money group, which is not required to disclose its donors even if it spends to influence elections. One Nation spent $125 million in the 2020 election cycle, according to the nonprofit OpenSecrets. That included spending on ads and contributing $85 million to McConnell’s super PAC.AP discloses the spendingThe ads cite a March news article by TheAssociated Press that said the three leisure projects were among scores of projects that state and local governments funded with the coronavirus relief money ""despite having little to do with combating the pandemic.""The money came from the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which included $350 billion in funds to help state and local governments.

All five supervisors are Republicans, the American Independent noted.The largest expenditure cited by The Associated Press was $400 million to build new prisons in Alabama. Alabama Republicans argued that the expenditure addressed a public safety need and is allowed under a provision to replace lost revenue and shore up state services. Alabama prisons are widely considered dilapidated and unsafe.Legislation for that spending was signed in October by Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican. Lawsuits, including one filed in July, are attempting to block the spending. Loose rules on spending the $350 billionSpending on the leisure projects was made possible by relatively loose rules in how state and local governments could spend the $350 billion.Senate Democrats promoted the eligible uses as ""broader"" than those for a similar fund contained in the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, a coronavirus relief bill signed by Trump in March 2020.Treasury Department rules said the $350 billion was for state and local governments ""to respond to the COVID-19 emergency and bring back jobs.""

Ron Johnson, a Republican seeking a third term in November 2022, included this statement:""Thanks to failed Dem policies, beer is 9.1% more expensive.""To which those of us in Brew City can say only: Whoa.Have beer prices jumped that much? And is it really Democratic policies that have caused any increase? Let’s take a look. Beer prices have been steadily rising since the 1990sWhen asked for backup for the claim, Johnson’s campaign pointed to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which shows the average price of a malt beverage in an average U.S. city over the years. According to the data, the average cost of 16 ounces of beer has gone from $1.50 in April 2020 to $1.66 in June 2022, which amounts to a 10.7% increase in the retail price. But there are important things to note.First, in April 2020, Republican Donald Trump was president — so, as a basic, practical matter, the blame would have to be shared.What’s more, the price of beer has been steadily rising since 1996, the bureau’s statistics show.

In it, the blame is placed on spending by the Biden administration, mainly pointing to the coronavirus aid package passed shortly after Joe Biden was inaugurated, which provided $1,400 stimulus checks to all Americans. The article cites a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, but even that headline says only that Biden policies ""helped fuel"" inflation.In April 2022, PolitiFact National looked at a claim that Biden's spending ""has sent prices skyrocketing,"" rating it Half True. The item found that while some inflation was driven by those stimulus checks, that wasn’t the only cause. There are many other factors that have to be taken into account, such as changes in the labor market, rising energy prices, supply chain problems and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A June 2022 examination by factcheck.org also said that while the stimulus money had a small impact on inflation, many other factors are playing into the rising costs. For the most part, the exceptional circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic — especially the shutdown of the economy during the early days and the fast-following recovery — have played a larger role. That upheaval in the economy caused supply chain shortages, created labor issues and changed spending habits for people forced to remain home. In any case, on claims like these — ones targeting Democrats or Republicans — we have long held that blame (or credit) for what happens in a complicated world economy can’t be attributed solely to a single person or event.Our rulingJohnson claimed in a tweet that the price of beer has risen 9.1% because of Democratic policies enacted in the U.S. While the price of beer did rise 10.7% starting in April 2020, some of that increase came on Trump’s watch — and prices have been steadily rising since the late 1990s. And although policies enacted by Democrats, such as the American Rescue Plan, have played a role in inflation, there are many other factors that are influencing the rising costs of goods and services, such as the fallout from the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, changes in the labor market and rising energy costs. We rate this claim Half True, meaning it’s partially accurate, but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.  window.gciAnalyticsUAID = 'PMJS-TEALIUM-COBRAND';window.gciAnalyticsLoadEvents = false;window.gciAnalytics.view({    'event-type': 'pageview',    'content-type': 'interactives',    'content-ssts-section': 'news',    'content-ssts-subsection': 'news:politics',    'content-ssts-topic': 'news:politics:politifactwisconsin',    'content-ssts-subtopic': ' news:politics:politifactwisconsin'});",Ron Johnson,"July 18, 2022",half-true

He has not specified what criminal penalties, if any, he would support if a woman had an unlawful abortion.Oz also has not commented publicly on Republican efforts to remove the right to an abortion from Pennsylvania’s constitution.Ad’s claim lacks evidenceTo back its claim that Oz wants to criminalize abortions in Pennsylvania, the ad includes a footnote citing conservative talk show host Sean Hannity’s radio program from Dec. 23, 2021. That day, Hannity asked Oz about choosing Supreme Court justices and referenced Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Mississippi case that the court later used to overturn Roe. Oz said he wanted the justices ""to make their decisions based on what the Constitution says.""

On July 8, the state’s Senate and House passed a bill that would ask voters to amend the state constitution to declare that there is no right to abortion in Pennsylvania. The bill must be passed a second time and the earliest voters could weigh in is 2023.If voters support the question to amend the state constitution, it would not ban abortion or change the existing law that makes abortion legal; that would require the state to pass a new law. Under such a new law, a governor likely would be unable to cite the state constitution if they wished to issue executive orders to protect abortion rights, said Pennsylvania State University law professor Dara Purvis. New laws restricting abortion would also be more difficult to challenge in court on state constitutional grounds, said University of Pennsylvania law professor Allison Hoffman. We did not find that Oz has made any statements about the constitutional amendment push.

63,Vanessa Swales,The RNC is “a $200 million economic infusion into our communities.”,"Editor's Note: Since this item was first published, VISIT Milwaukee reduced its estimate for hotel revenue from the RNC. The change is reflected in the text. In 2020, before the pandemic upended plans, the fact the Democratic National Convention was coming to Milwaukee was widely cheered. Now, with a decision looming on whether the city will get to host the 2024 Republican National Convention, views are more mixed.Liberal groups from across the state have called on city officials to reject the convention, citing Republicans who continue to question the results of the 2020 presidential election and a range of other criticisms. But the Milwaukee Common Council ultimately endorsed an agreement with the Republican National Committee, which is to decide between Milwaukee and Nashville in the coming weeks.Various city officials, including Mayor Cavalier Johnson, have boasted of the benefits of holding the convention – including one boast that we found goes too far.During a May 27, 2022 news conference, Johnson said that the RNC is ""a $200 million economic infusion into our communities.""Let’s dig in.Estimates based on 2016 RNC in ClevelandThe $200 million number was based on estimates from the city’s tourism bureau, VISIT Milwaukee, according to a Johnson spokesperson. The estimate, in turn, was based on a study by Cleveland State University on the economic impact of the 2016 RNC in Cleveland.So why use the 2016 RNC as a basis?VISIT Milwaukee used the study for a number of reasons, including that it’s the most recent non-pandemic political convention. What’s more, Milwaukee has a similar population and geography to Cleveland, said Peggy Williams-Smith, president and CEO of VISIT Milwaukee.""We’re confident that this convention will have not only a short-term economic boost, especially for our hospitality businesses, but will lead to more and larger meetings in the long run,"" Williams-Smith said.She noted that Cleveland officials believe the 2016 RNC played a role in securing the NBA and Major League Baseball all-star games.Williams-Smith believes that hotel nights alone could generate $32 million (the convention is expected to draw about 45,000 people and will have to secure at least 16,000 rooms for state delegations) and other parts of the hospitality industry will benefit. Note: (After this item was published, VISIT Milwaukee reduced its estimate of revenue from hotels to $23.2 million.""It should not be forgotten that one amazing part about Milwaukee is how many of our restaurants are locally owned and totally unique to our city,"" she told PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""Many of them will benefit just as the hotels will.""Stretched projections? Very likely.Let’s look more closely at the Cleveland study, which was completed by a four-person team at Cleveland State University’s Center for Economic Development.Featured Fact-checkPublic Interest Legal Foundationstated on January 18, 2023 in a reportIn California, there were “10 million mail ballots unaccounted for” in the November midterm election.By Jeff Cercone • January 26, 2023The Cleveland study examined the RNC’s economic impact through spending by the RNC Host Committee, spending by the city of Cleveland, and visitor spending.The total labor income tied to Cleveland hosting the RNC reached $52.4 million and the value-added impact was $84.8 million — bringing the total impact to $142.2 million, according to the study. The RNC was responsible for $16.9 million in taxes (that’s 30% in state and local taxes and 70% in federal taxes).All in all, the overall economic impact of Cleveland hosting the RNC in 2016 included 855 direct jobs, $27.6 million in labor income and supported 1,348 total jobs.So, does that make the $200 million estimate from VISIT Milwaukee correct?One academic who has studied the fiscal impact of national political conventions says the estimate is likely far higher than the actual impact will be, especially when you look at how the local economy will benefit.Victor Matheson, an economics professor at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, along with two co-authors carried out an extensive peer-reviewed study that analyzed the economic impact on cities who have hosted the Republican and Democratic national conventions from 1970 to 2004.The study carried out by Matheson and other academics discerned that there were no ""significant wage gains for local employees"" and that the ""economic gain from the event does not accrue to the host city but rather benefits the bottom line back at corporate headquarters.""The report found the presence of the Republican or Democratic convention had ""no discernible impact on employment, personal income, or personal income per capita in the cities."" It also noted that many studies exaggerate the ""multiplier"" effect of money spent in the community, which is meant to approximate how often it changes hands.For instance, money paid to a hotel goes products from local companies and goes to pay staff members, who in turn spend it on gas, food and even their own entertainment.When looking at just the hotel revenue, Matheson told us the study found revenue increased by $20 million on average.""It's pretty hard to get from $20 million of hotel revenue, up to $200 million in total economic activity,"" he said, adding: ""Even if you could get $200 million worth of expenditures, it certainly wouldn't be $200 million of money that winds up in the pockets of local Milwaukee residents.""For a convention, much of the money will quickly leave the community, he said, providing these examples among others:Conventions typically bring in police officers from other cities to augment their own and be paid for it.Stockholders in big national hotel chains and car rental services will reap profits.Uber drivers who may come up from Chicago or other cities to take advantage of surge pricing.""I think it's almost certainly wildly exaggerated,"" Matheson said.Our rulingJohnson claimed the RNC is ""a $200 million economic infusion into our communities.""While the figure from VISIT Milwaukee is grounded in the experience of Cleveland in 2016, an expert who has studied a range of past conventions say it is ""wildly exaggerated."" What’s more, even if anticipated spending figures were reached, much of the money would quickly leave the local economy for other places.We rate the claim Half True. window.gciAnalyticsUAID = 'PMJS-TEALIUM-COBRAND';window.gciAnalyticsLoadEvents = false;window.gciAnalytics.view({    'event-type': 'pageview',    'content-type': 'interactives',    'content-ssts-section': 'news',    'content-ssts-subsection': 'news:politics',    'content-ssts-topic': 'news:politics:politifactwisconsin',    'content-ssts-subtopic': ' news:politics:politifactwisconsin'});",Cavalier Johnson,"July 8, 2022",half-true

65,Laura Schulte,"Says U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, his prospective opponent, has received $1.2 million from the gun lobby.","Following the mass shooting at a school in Uvalde, Texas, the U.S. Senate has moved to address gun violence — a measure some argues does too little, while others say goes too far.In Wisconsin, Democrats running for the U.S. Senate have been targeting incumbent Ron Johnson, a Republican seeking a third term. That includes Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who in a May 27, 2022, news release said:""Ron Johnson will do or say anything to distract from the $1.2 million he’s taken from the gun lobby."" Has Johnson really accepted that much money from the pro-gun lobby? Not all donations are directly received by candidates during a campaign When we reached out to Barnes’ campaign, press secretary Lauren Chou pointed to data collected by Brady United, a nonpartisan gun violence prevention group founded after the passage of the Brady Law in 1993. The data outlines which U.S. senators have benefitted the most from donations from the National Rifle Association. According to the data, Johnson has received nearly $1.27 million from the NRA during his time as a senator, including both direct campaign contributions and indirect spending, such as TV commercials. OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan nonprofit research group that tracks money in politics, had similar numbers. According to its database on spending by gun interest groups, Johnson has received $222,529 in direct support, in addition to more than $1 million in outside spending since he took office in 2017. (That counts spending in support of Johnson, or against his opponents). That leads to an important distinction we want to underline.While Johnson has received about $1.2 million in overall support from pro-gun groups since his first election in 2010, only about $223,000 has been directly accepted by his campaign. As noted, the other $1 million has been spent on his behalf by those groups. Featured Fact-checkPublic Interest Legal Foundationstated on January 18, 2023 in a reportIn California, there were “10 million mail ballots unaccounted for” in the November midterm election.By Jeff Cercone • January 26, 2023So, Barnes is off in how he characterizes it.""We determined approximately 83 percent of the dollars they say Senator Johnson has ‘taken from the gun lobby’ are independent expenditures over which he had absolutely no control, and in fact, did not have any personal knowledge of,"" said Alexa Henning, a Johnson campaign spokesperson. For context, a May 27, 2022, report, TMJ4-TV in Milwaukee took a look at how the gun lobby’s spending on Johnson compares to other politicians.Johnson had the 15th highest total of any current elected officials in the U.S., the report said. It also noted that the NRA has spent more than $771,000 against Wisconsin’s other U.S. Senator, Democrat Tammy Baldwin. That’s the 10th highest dollar amount spent against any sitting elected official. Our rulingBarnes claimed Johnson has taken $1.2 million from the gun lobby. Data shows that Johnson has received — through both direct and indirect contributions — about $1.2 million in support since his first campaign started in 2016. But of that, only about $200,000 went directly to his campaign.

66,Louis Jacobson,“The majority of citizens in the country will have no change at all because … most of the population resides in states that have already protected abortion rights.”,"Shortly after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, the decision that protected the right to abortion nationally, George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley cautioned in an interview with Fox News that the immediate impact would be modest.""The majority of citizens in the country will have no change at all because … most of the population resides in states that have already protected abortion rights,"" Turley said June 24, the day of the decision.Whether he’s right depends on the definition of ""already protected.""By overturning Roe, the Supreme Court allowed states to decide for themselves whether to allow or prohibit abortion. In advance of the ruling, numerous states had either passed laws to preemptively protect abortion rights within their borders or passed ""trigger laws"" to outlaw the procedure if the court were to overrule Roe.In all, 16 states plus the District of Columbia passed laws directly allowing access to abortions: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.Collectively, these states account for 125.7 million residents, or 37.9% of the nation’s population of 331.4 million people as calculated by the 2020 Census.So by this standard of affirmatively acting to keep abortion legal — which would seem to be in line with Turley’s phrasing of ""states that have already protected abortion rights"" — he would be incorrect, since 37.9% is not equivalent to ""most of the population.""However, Turley told PolitiFact that he wasn’t using this as his definition. Rather, he was referring to the states that are left once the states that are banning abortion are removed from the equation.The core group of states in this category are those that passed ""trigger laws"" to ban abortion in the event that Roe was overturned. This includes 13 states: Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wyoming. The implementation timeline varies by state, but each of the 13 should have laws against abortion in place within weeks, if not sooner.Collectively, these 13 states account for 20.7% of the U.S. population.However, there are other states that can also ban abortions through existing laws.States that banned abortion pre-RoeSome states have laws predating Roe, often by decades, that could ""snap back"" to ban abortions in the absence of Roe’s protections. The five states in this category are Alabama, Arizona, Michigan, West Virginia and Wisconsin. These states account for another 9% of the population.Legal challenges to these old laws are expected, so the banning of abortion in these states may not be as swift or as certain as it is in the trigger-law states. Still, even if abortion remains legal in these states pending court challenges, it would be inaccurate to describe these five states using Turley’s phrasing — ""states that have already protected abortion rights.""Featured Fact-checkNational Right to Life Committeestated on July 13, 2010 in a prepared statementThe Obama administration will give Pennsylvania $160 million to pay for health insurance plans that cover ""any legal abortion.""By Angie Drobnic Holan • July 16, 2010States with abortion laws that had been blocked by courtsThen, there are states that have passed abortion bans that had been blocked by the courts during the period when Roe was in place. These laws would likely be allowed to go into effect now that Roe is gone, though that process may take some time. Four states fall into this category: Georgia, Iowa, Ohio and South Carolina. Together, they account for another 9.3% of the population.All told, states that are potentially on a path to outlawing abortion include up to 39% of the U.S. population. The flip side of this figure — and this is where Turley has a point — is that 61% of the population lives in states where abortion is poised to remain legal, at least in the short term. That’s because something not affirmatively banned is presumed legal. In many of these states, abortion is not actually ""protected"" by a law, to use Turley’s term. While abortion remains legal for now in these states, a law banning it could be passed at any time without having to repeal a law protecting abortion.Twelve states have neither explicitly protected abortion through a law nor do they have laws on the books that would ban abortion after the overturning of Roe. And they are a mixed bag politically. Some are generally blue or purple in their political orientation and are expected to keep abortion legal. These include Minnesota, New Hampshire and New Mexico. Others are strongly Republican and could pass laws in fairly short order to ban abortion if they wished, including Indiana, Montana and Nebraska.Other states where the future of abortion rights is unclear are solidly in the purple category and could see heated legislative sparring over abortion, including Pennsylvania and North Carolina.Ultimately, whether a majority of Americans end up living in states with or without legal abortion will depend on how these 12 states divide on this issue.Our rulingTurley said, ""The majority of citizens in the country will have no change at all because … most of the population resides in states that have already protected abortion rights.""We found that 38% of the population lives in states that have ""already protected abortion rights"" in the sense that they affirmatively passed laws to keep abortion legal in Roe’s absence.At the same time, another 39% of the population lives in states that have passed laws banning abortion and that are poised to go into effect with Roe’s overturning. This leaves 61% of the population — a majority — living in a state where, for now at least, the overturning of Roe isn’t changing the legal status of abortion. In many of these states, abortion is not actually ""protected"" by a law but rather by the principle that something not affirmatively banned is presumed to be legal.We rate the statement Half True.",Jonathan Turley,"June 27, 2022",half-true

As Nevada's attorney general, Laxalt supported efforts that would have restricted access to birth control. But he hasn’t spoken publicly about this issue during his Senate campaign.On the abortion claim, we didn’t find that Laxalt has said he would entirely eliminate abortion protections. But he supports holding a referendum asking Nevada voters to restrict abortion after 13 weeks of pregnancy. That would be a tighter restriction than under current Nevada law.Laxalt’s campaign did not respond to our call and emails. His campaign website describes Laxalt as ""pro-life"" and says he opposes taxpayer funding for abortions."" It also says he opposes codifying ""barbaric partial-birth abortion practices as federal law.""Roe and abortion rights in NevadaAbortion rights became a pivotal election issue after the May 2 leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court case. If the draft is finalized, it would effectively eliminate the national right to an abortion and leave it up to each state to decide their own policies. Nevada is one of 16 states, plus the District of Columbia, that has passed laws protecting access to abortions. Nevada law allows abortion through 24 weeks of pregnancy and after 24 weeks, if it is to preserve the woman’s life or health. Nevada’s law was passed by the state legislature and later adopted by voters in a 1990 referendum, which passed with 63% of the vote. In Nevada, when a statute is affirmed by voters in a referendum, it can only be changed by another referendum. So the state’s abortion protections would stay in place even if Roe were overturned. Nevada’s law would be superseded, however, if there were a national law banning abortion. Laxalt on abortion referendumAfter Politico published the Supreme Court draft, Laxalt said in a statement that if the draft reflects the court’s ultimate ruling, it would be an ""historic victory for the sanctity of life."" But, alluding to the 1990 referendum, he said that even if Roe were overturned, Nevadans had ""already voted to make abortion rights legal in our state,"" and that the matter is ""settled law.""Laxalt has not campaigned on restricting abortion access but, he has indicated support for going to Nevada voters with a new referendum that would restrict abortion after 13 weeks. Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 18, 2023 in a Facebook post“The average American has anywhere from 5 to 15 pounds” of stool stuck in their gut.By Madison Czopek • January 27, 2023Cortez Masto’s campaign cited as evidence for its claim a May 14 opinion article by a Las Vegas Review-Journal columnist giving advice to Nevada Republicans.""Propose sending voters a 13-week abortion ban with exceptions for physical health, rape and incest.

Secondly, we’re in a stronger position than any nation in the world to overcome this inflation. It’s bad. Isn’t it kind of interesting?

These were predominantly Baltic and Eastern European nations, which have been hit especially hard by the consequences of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.But a larger number of OECD members had inflation rates lower than 8.6%, and these include all but one member of the G-7 group, which is limited to the world’s very largest democratic economies.Among the G-7 nations, Germany’s most recent inflation rate was 7.9%, the United Kingdom’s was 7.8%, Italy’s and Canada’s were 6.8%, and France’s was 5.2%.

69,Nina Baker,"$3 million per day in ""your tax dollars"" are being spent to guard ""unused border wall materials.""","Republicans, including members of Congress from Iowa, continue to criticize President Biden for how he is handling the U.S.-Mexican border. Rep. Ashley Hinson went to the border as June started to bring attention to her opposition to Biden's handling of border security. Sen. Chuck Grassley says he too is fighting Biden’s border policies.U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, has been especially active on border policies, writing in a May 28 newsletter: ""Well here’s something you may not know your tax dollars are being spent on: unused border wall materials.""This has been happening since Biden terminated construction of President Trump’s wall on the U.S.-Mexico border on Jan. 20, 2021, Ernst wrote. Grassley said he agrees with her assessment. Ernst’s claim raises questions about responsible federal spending, so we took a look at it. The claim, which her office said comes from a 2021 Senate Republican staff report criticizing spending on unused materials at the border, made the rounds in conservative media in conjunction with Ernst introducing the BUILD IT Act in May. That act would terminate contracts relating to building the border wall and transfer unused fence material to Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas state government on the southwest border.In total, Trump had planned to spend $16.5 billion on the border wall: $10 billion from funds diverted from the Defense Department, $5.8 billion from a congressional appropriation and $600 million from forfeitures collected by the Treasury Department, a May 2021 Congressional Research Service report stated.In the days before Biden was inaugurated in 2021, Trump ramped up construction of the border wall by extending for one year a national emergency he had declared in February 2019 to build the wall. Biden suspended all construction on his first day in office, leaving unused steel panels and piping at construction sites along the border.Most estimates place the value of surplus material at $265 million, with some estimates as high as $350 million.Some of the material intended for the border wall is being used elsewhere. In February 2022, more than 1,700 unused panels were donated by the federal government to Texas to help build Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s state-funded border wall. A Defense Department spokesman said the total value of all the donated panels was $6 million, the Arizona Daily Star reported.The Daily Star reported that federal agencies receiving materials include U.S. Customs and Border Protection, along with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). But representatives from neither agency responded to questions about how much material was received. The Interior Department also received nearly $1 million in bulk packaging and miscellaneous construction materials.Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security authorized in December 2021 use of some of the remaining materials to close breaches in a Texas levee along the Rio Grande River and to backfill erosion in San Diego. The Biden Administration said wall construction created these problems. A Department of Homeland Security press release said other clean-up projects at construction sites have been approved, including road repair and installing drainage systems. Ernst wrote in her newsletter that guarding these materials costs ""millions of dollars per day."" Her staff cited for PolitiFact Iowa the Interim Minority Report issued in July 2021 from the Subcommittee on Government Operations and Border Management. That Republican report states that, at the time of publication, the Defense Department continued to spend $3 million per day ""to guard steel, concrete, and other materials in the desert.""Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 27, 2023 in a Facebook postU.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar is ""facing 40 years in prison and deportation after seven new crimes uncovered.""By Tom Kertscher • February 2, 2023The estimate of $3 million in costs per day has not been confirmed independently.The Republican report stated that the cost was determined through communications with the Defense Department and the Subcommittee on Government Operations and Border Management. The Republicans’ 2021 congressional report does not state if the costs for clean-up projects is included in the $3 million daily figure.Canceled contracts still cost taxpayers because the Defense Department has to negotiate its withdrawal from seven remaining contracts, the Republican report states. Department estimates show the federal government could spend at least $798 million and $1.048 billion by the end of 2022 on leaving contracts for the seven projects, the report states.A February 2021 U.S. Government Accountability Office report said the Defense Department spent about $1 billion helping at the border in fiscal years 2018 through 2020. But, the report stated, the department was late in providing more accurate costs for that time period and was not tracking internal costs.Military personnel at the border may only support Homeland Security officers and cannot make arrests. Homeland Security officials wanted the military to stay in the region three to five years, the 2021 report stated, but reliable cost estimates for doing so were not available. About $5.3 billion of the Defense Department’s diverted funding had been spent on wall construction and about $4.75 billion remained committed when Biden took office, the May 2021 non-partisan Congressional Research Service report stated. News reports in June 2021 said Biden returned the last batch of diverted funds – more than $2 billion – to the Defense Department.Defense Department leaders estimated it would cost the federal government around $1.4 billion to suspend and terminate contracts, pending negotiations with contractors to cancel them, an internal department memo stated.We asked Ernst’s Senate staff whether or not the costs of these clean-up projects are accounted for in $3 million daily costs. Staff responded in an email that these are projects ""that the Biden administration is currently spending taxpayer money on as a result of President Biden’s decision to cancel the border wall, which was already under construction."" Ernst’s office also did not answer if the $3 million per day cost has changed since last July.Our rulingErnst’s May 28 newsletter claims that unused materials remain at construction sites, and that taxpayers are footing the bill to guard these materials. How much waste exists is a judgment call but Ernst is correct that around $265 million dollars in manufacturing materials, including panels, electrical supplies and light poles, were left at construction sites along the southern border with Mexico after Biden halted border wall construction.However, some of these materials are being used to repair gaps at insecure points in the barrier, while others have been sent to other government agencies, including the state of Texas for wall construction. No independent source has confirmed the $3 million daily cost that Ernst cites, and a nonpartisan government agency says reliable cost estimates for Defense Department work at the border are lacking or late.

Mark Kelly.""Blake Masters would be shred to pieces by Mark Kelly and the Democrats as someone who has unironically quoted a Nazi, called World War II an unjust war, called the Unabomber one of his intellectual influencers, and shared an article attacking Israel as the North Korea of the Middle East,"" Lamon tweeted June 2, the same day Trump issued his endorsement.Under the banner of America First, Lamon and Masters share many common policy positions. They both have questioned the results of the 2020 presidential election. They say tougher border security is a matter of public safety, and see China as a key threat to American jobs. They oppose ""critical race theory"" in schools, although it isn’t part of K-12 school curricula. Neither man has run for office before.

(AP)Yes, Masters quoted a Nazi, but context here matters. It appeared in a 2006 essay Masters wrote while in college at Stanford University.The essay was 19-year-old Masters’ take on how the government uses propaganda to win popular support for war. (Masters is now 35.) In the piece, Masters argued that ""government creates war for no good reason."" War, he said, enriches the wealthy and does nothing for the average citizen. Masters described how President Woodrow Wilson built the case for America’s entry into World War I, and how the largest banks profited from it.The essay ends with a quote from Hermann Goering, convicted war criminal and Adolf Hitler’s right-hand man during the Nazi regime.""The people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders,"" Goering said in an interview with American psychologist Gustave Gilbert, who published the statement in his book, ""Nuremberg Diary."" ""That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.""The quote highlighted the sort of manipulative messaging that Masters condemned in his essay.‘Called WWII an unjust war’Masters’ use of ""unjust"" came from the same college essay.

Kaczynski has written about industrialization in multiple books and in his published manifesto, where he argued that destroying industrial society is necessary for restoring the environment and human satisfaction.  ""He’s a terrorist, you shouldn’t hurt people, obviously,"" Masters said in the interview. ""There’s a lot that I disagree with, right, like this is not an endorsement, but there’s a lot of insight there that is correct."" Masters said he broadly agreed with Kaczynski's criticisms of industrial society and his view that the political left ""fundamentally hate(s) anything like goodness, truth, beauty, justice."" Masters never named the Unabomber as one of his ""intellectual influencers,"" but he did say ""everybody should read"" Kaczynski’s work and decide what they agree and disagree with. ‘Shared an article attacking Israel as the North Korea of the Middle East’In 2010, Masters shared to his father’s Facebook page a link to an article that likened Israel to North Korea.The 2010 article on a libertarian website (the same one that republished Masters’ 2006 college essay) detailed the plight Gazans and Palestinians face under the ""unjust rule of the Israeli military.""

71,Laura Schulte,"""Nearly 60% of all student loan debt is held by the rich and upper-middle class,"" so forgiveness would give the wealthy a ""financial windfall"" but not really help low-income people.","President Joe Biden and his administration are once again revisiting the idea of student loan forgiveness, a controversial idea that could allow for some – or even all – student debt to be erased. While some have pushed for debt forgiveness, seeing it as a potential injection of money into the economy, others – including U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wisconsin — have questioned the idea. ""Nearly 60% of all student loan debt is held by the rich and upper-middle class,"" he said in a May 21, 2022, newsletter. ""So, by forgiving student loan debt, we would be handing the wealthy a financial windfall while low income Americans suffer further from inflation and rising costs."" For this fact-check, we’re going to look at the portion of the claim about who holds student loan debt, and whether or not forgiveness would help low-income people. Wealthier majors tend to make more money after college, spend more on degrees When asked for backup for the claim, Grothman’s office shared a couple of sources of information with us. The first was an analysis from EducationData.org, a group of researchers who collect data and statistics about U.S. education. According to the May 8, 2022, report, Americans with income over $74,000 hold about 60% of the total public student loan debt, while households that earn $35,000 or less a year hold about 20% of the total public student loan debt. According to the group, those earning $74,000 or more are considered middle to upper-middle class, while those earning $35,000 or less are considered lower-middle class or poor.So, Grothman is mischaracterizing the data a bit, inasmuch as he’s labeling that group the ""rich and upper-middle class.""Looking further at who has student debt, many of those who pursue graduate degrees owe more money, according to a Jan. 21, 2022 article from Forbes. That’s perfectly logical, in that there is more education to pay for.For example, a young doctor may owe about $200,000 in medical student debt, but medicine is also one of the best-paid professions in the U.S. That means the student’s lifetime income prospects would allow them to pay off their loans. Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on January 27, 2023 in a Rumble post“Biden smirks while saying he has added more to the debt than any president before him.”By Ciara O'Rourke • January 31, 2023Grothman’s office also shared a Brookings article from February 2022, which outlined how those who stand to see the most money forgiven would be higher income, better educated and white. ""Beneficiaries of across-the-board student loan forgiveness would be higher income, better educated, and more likely to be white than beneficiaries of just about all other programs designed to reduce hardship and promote opportunity and targeted to those who need help,"" the article said. ""Prioritizing spending on targeted programs would therefore be a more effective way to achieve progressive goals."" The article then highlights the child tax-credit program as an example of a program that might directly benefit more people living in poverty than student loan debt forgiveness. In any case, Grothman is largely right on the numbers.But he misfires a bit in suggesting that loan forgiveness would not matter much to low-income people. For college graduates in lesser-paying jobs, it might make a huge difference in terms of their finances.Adam Looney, executive director of the Marriner S. Eccles Institute at the University of Utah and a nonresident fellow in economic studies for the Brookings Institute, noted that wealthy people aren’t the only ones to attend college. ""Some low-income people also have student debt, so they would also be helped by forgiveness. It’s just that they are less likely to have debt at all (because they are less likely to have been able to go to college in the first place) and have less debt if they go to college (often because they haven’t finished a degree or went to a low-cost community college,)"" he said in an email. ""So I think poor people do not benefit as much as higher-income households from across-the-board debt forgiveness policies."" Our rulingGrothman claimed that most student loan debt is held by wealthier people, meaning that student loan debt forgiveness would be a ""windfall"" for the rich and not make much difference for low-income people. It is true that people with higher incomes hold more debt — often because they attended graduate school and, if the loan is bigger, it would be more of a ""windfall"" to them. But people with lower incomes also attend college, and on an individual level may benefit proportionately more from student loan debt forgiveness.

In broad strokes, it’s generally accurate but misleading without some important context that could give readers a different impression. The first monkeypox cases in the current outbreak were reported to the World Health Organization on May 13. Five days later, Bavarian Nordic, a vaccine company based in Denmark, announced that the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, better known as BARDA, had exercised options under an existing contract with the company to order $119 million worth of a freeze-dried version of a smallpox vaccine called Jynneos. (Freeze-dried doses have a longer shelf life, Forbes reported.)Bavarian Nordic has worked with the U.S. government since 2003 to develop, manufacture and supply smallpox vaccines, and to date, the company has supplied nearly 30 million doses of a liquid-frozen version of the vaccine to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, according to a press release.

But the claim’s premise lacks context.Over the past two decades, more and more schools have opted to bolster their security measures. The amount of public schools with security cameras increased from 19% in 1999 to 91% in 2020, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. The number of schools with locked or monitored building doors also went up during that time.While school budgets vary by state and school district, an estimated $2.7 billion was spent on U.S. school security equipment and services in 2017, according to Omdia, a market-research company. And billions more are spent each year to pay school resource officers, The Washington Post reported.Following the 2018 mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida, spending on school safety programs increased by $960 million across at least 26 states, according to education news site The 74. The federal government also allocated an additional $2.3 billion to school safety that year.The premise of the claim also falls short in that research shows no evidence that arming teachers — or in this case, hiring a SWAT team for each school — will protect students in future gun-related incidents.Following the tragedy in Uvalde, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, falsely claimed that having armed law enforcement on campus is ""the most effective tool for keeping kids safe.""But researchers and experts say that when it comes to preventing school shootings, there appears to be more evidentiary support for efforts that emphasize early intervention and support for students than there is for having armed law enforcement on campus.Why has the U.S. sent $53 billion in aid to Ukraine?Two weeks after Russia’s invasion began, Congress approved a $13.6 billion aid package to arm and equip Ukrainian forces and provide humanitarian and economic assistance to the region. Then, on May 19, as the invasion neared the three-month mark, the Senate voted 86-11 to approve the largest military and humanitarian aid package for the country to date, bringing the total spending to more than $53 billion.The $40 billion aid package included:About $24 billion to help Ukrainian forces finance weapons purchases, to replenish stocks of U.S. equipment sent to the country and to pay for U.S. troops deployed in nearby countries;More than $13 billion in humanitarian assistance and economic support for Ukraine and other countries affected by the war.With bipartisan support, the aid package was designed to sustain Ukraine for months, rather than weeks, as was the goal of the initial funding.Featured Fact-checkBloggersstated on January 15, 2023 in a blog postThe World Economic Forum hired “unvaccinated pilots” to fly people into Davos, Switzerland, for its annual meeting for safety reasons.By Ciara O'Rourke • January 18, 2023Do armed officers make schools safer?Half of all public K-12 schools in the country already employ law enforcement or school resource officers who routinely carry firearms, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Those in favor of having these armed officers at schools see them as the first line of defense against shooters and other threats.But the consensus among many experts is that armed officers don’t prevent mass school shootings.A 2021 study published by JAMA Network, the American Medical Association’s open access journal, analyzed mass school shootings from 1980 to 2019. The study found the data suggested ""no association between having an armed officer and deterrence of violence in these cases.""Another 2021 study by the Rand Corp., a nonprofit research organization, and the University at Albany, evaluated data from schools between 2014 and 2018 to determine the impact of school resource officers. It found that while school resource officers can protect students from some forms of violence, like physical attacks and fights, there is ""no evidence that SROs prevent school shootings or reduce more serious firearm-related offenses.""In 2018, the Rand Corp. launched a research initiative analyzing thousands of scientific studies to determine the effectiveness of 18 different U.S. gun policies. Through this, Rand found inconclusive evidence that any of these policies, including laws that allow armed staff at K-12 schools, have increased or decreased mass shootings.How can school shootings be prevented?Research and experts say there is no simple solution.One approach, though, is for schools to have effective early intervention and support systems for students who are experiencing distress.Students tend to show a range of concerning behaviors as their actions escalate to violence. A 2021 study by the U.S. Secret Service concluded that threat assessment — in other words, learning how to recognize behavioral warning signs and intervening effectively — is the best way to prevent targeted school violence.The Educator’s School Safety Network recommends schools take a comprehensive, all-hazards approach to planning for, preventing and responding to violent incidents. This includes threat assessment and security measures, as well as looking for potential vulnerabilities within the school and its daily operations.Often, there is ""a big discrepancy between what the school has written down as a policy or procedure and what they actually do on a day-to-day basis,"" said Amy Klinger, co-founder of the Educator’s School Safety Network. ""And that big discrepancy is a safety issue not just for active shooter (events), but for all kinds of potential safety issues.""Our rulingA Facebook post claimed that with the $53 billion spent in Ukraine aid, the U.S. ""could pay five SWAT members $80,000 each and have them at EVERY school front door.""The U.S. has allocated about $53 billion in aid to Ukraine. And if one wanted to pay this amount to station five SWAT members at every public and private K-12 school in the country, it would also add up to about $53 billion over one year.But that statement alone lacks context about current security funding for schools and what research shows about the effect of such measures.More than $2.7 billion is already spent each year on school safety equipment and services nationwide. And this $53 billion, if spent as the claim suggested, would cover just one year of SWAT team coverage for schools.Additionally, research shows that the presence of armed officers on campuses does not help prevent school shootings from happening.We rate this claim Half True.RELATED: Research: Armed campus police do not prevent school shootingsRELATED: How do we prevent school shootings?",Facebook posts,"June 3, 2022",half-true

Harry Reid, D-Nev., established a 60-vote threshold on all amendments to his Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013.Reid’s technique — allowing a fixed number of amendments for both sides, each requiring a 60-vote majority for passage — has become common in the Senate in recent years, said Steven S. Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis and author of ""The Senate Syndrome: The Evolution of Procedural Warfare in the Modern U.S. Senate.""It usually happens like this: The minority party makes clear they’re going to filibuster an underlying bill, as Republicans did with the gun legislation backed by the Democratic leadership in 2013. To counter this filibuster threat, the majority leader uses a procedural maneuver to block the minority from offering any amendments. This inevitably produces a stalemate. The usual way of resolving this stalemate is for each side to agree to vote on a limited number of amendments, each with a stiff 60-vote threshold.""Sounds crazy, right?"" Smith said. ""It is, but it gives senators on both sides an opportunity to offer alternatives and put senators on the record.""The parameters for debate and voting are set in motion by the majority leader’s ""unanimous consent"" request. If any senator objects to the majority leader’s request, the voting plan doesn’t go forward. But as long as no one objects, the votes on amendments can proceed, with the supermajority threshold.An important point Cruz leaves out is that every Republican accepted Reid’s ground rules.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 23, 2023 in a Facebook postVideo shows Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez crying after “Ted Cruz gets up and humiliates her to her face.”By Ciara O'Rourke • January 26, 2023The Senate’s makeup at the time was 55 Democrats and 45 Republicans.Ultimately, when the voting was held on April 17, 2013, nine amendments received a vote. A few that were relatively uncontroversial passed with a 60-vote supermajority, while a few fell short of even a simple 50-vote majority.The Cruz-Grassley amendment attracted majority support, but not 60 votes. It received a vote of 52-48, with nine Democrats voting for it (Max Baucus and Jon Tester of Montana, Mark Begich of Alaska, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Mark Pryor or Arkansas) and two Republicans voting against (Mark Kirk of Illinois and Mike Lee of Utah).The same day, the Senate voted on an amendment sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., that would have toughened background checks for purchasing guns. The Manchin-Toomey amendment, which was backed by the Democratic leadership, also received a majority vote (54-46) but it, too, fell short of the 60 votes required for passage. It attracted two more votes than Grassley-Cruz did.Four Republicans joined most Democrats in supporting Manchin-Toomey — Susan Collins of Maine, Kirk, John McCain of Arizona, and Toomey. Five Democrats joined Republicans in opposition: Baucus, Begich, Heitkamp, Pryor, and Reid. (Reid’s vote against it was not due to the substance of the measure but rather as a procedural tactic that would allow him to call the amendment up at a later date.)Meanwhile, two other amendments secured majority support but fell short of 60 votes. One focused on firearm trafficking and was sponsored by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. It resulted in a 58-42 vote. Another amendment that addressed veterans’ gun rights was sponsored by Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C. It produced a 56-44 vote.Steve Guest, a special advisor for communications with Cruz, said the senator’s statement was ""absolutely correct."" Guest said it is ""disingenuous to say that somehow the blame is on both sides of the aisle for filibustering Grassley-Cruz. The fact of the matter is Grassley-Cruz would have passed had over 80% of the Democrats in the Senate not blocked it via the filibuster.""This recording of history is incomplete, however. Reid set the 60-vote threshold in response to Republican threats to filibuster the Democratic measure, meaning that both sides were playing the same game. And to get out of the standoff, Republicans unanimously agreed to the 60-vote threshold Reid established for all amendments. This endgame has been common since the 1990s, Smith said, creating a system where senators on either side can avoid accountability by taking votes that have no chance of passage but serve the party’s campaign messaging.""Senators can make all kinds of claims that are half-truths, and the public cannot possibly make sense of it,"" Smith said.Our rulingCruz said that in 2013, under a Democratic Senate, ""a majority of the Senate voted in favor of"" the Grassley-Cruz amendment to tighten background checks, ""but the Democrats filibustered it.""This retelling is accurate up to a point, but it leaves out half the story. Reid set a 60-vote threshold for all amendments because the Republicans’ made their own filibuster threats against what the Democrats wanted to pass. To get out of the standoff, Republicans unanimously agreed to the 60-vote threshold for all amendments. The Cruz-Grassley amendment attracted majority support, but not 60 votes.

75,Lyle Muller,"“Zack Nunn saved over 2,000 Americans abandoned in Afghanistan by leading private rescue missions.”","The chaotic last days of the U.S. war in Afghanistan that ended Aug. 30, 2021, created a need that active and veteran military members felt compelled to address: people who needed help leaving the country but had difficulty doing so. Some of those in Afghanistan were Americans, while plenty more were Afghans who helped the United States in its war with the Taliban. Iowa state Sen. Zach Nunn, a U.S. Air Force aircrew intelligence officer who flew 700 combat hours over Afghanistan and also a cybersecurity expert in the Obama Administration’s National Security Council staff, was among those responding, co-founding an organization called Task Force Argo. It’s an experience that Nunn, of Altoona and seeking the Republican nomination for Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District seat, is letting people know.""Zack Nunn saved over 2,000 Americans abandoned in Afghanistan by leading private rescue missions,"" a video ad for Nunn states.Our research shows the ad overshoots how many Americans he personally led out of Afghanistan but that some Americans in Afghanistan still are being helped by Nunn and Task Force Argo. ""I would be skeptical of the overall number and skeptical of that number of Americans,"" said Joe Saboe, founder of the volunteer group Team America. Saboe said Team America, one of the largest private groups evacuating people from Afghanistan, flew out around 150 Americans as U.S. troops left Afghanistan. ""It strikes me as high,"" Saboe told PolitiFact. ""More to the point, though, very few politicians were actually helpful during that time, and that goes for both parties,"" he said about the federal government’s response to refugees trying to get out of Afghanistan as the Taliban won the war in August 201, and the need for groups like Task Force Argo and Team America to step in and help.Groups like Task Force Argo, a nationwide collection of volunteer veterans and private citizens, have brought out of the country or has helped with logistics for Afghan nationals at risk living under Taliban rule for helping the United States during its war with the Taliban. Americans are its first priority, the group states.Nunn said in one of two PolitiFact interviews that his group has tracked since Aug. 31 ""upwards of 2,000 Americans"" and reported that to the State Department. ""We still stay in contact with a weekly call with the State Department to help evacuate those individuals. And we have roughly 5,000-plus Afghan and American citizens in safe houses still in the country,"" Nunn said. Americans staying there often are doing so because they have family members who are not U.S. citizens and are having difficulty getting permission to leave, Nunn and others said.A Philadelphia Enquirer report Oct. 21, 2021, had the Task Force Ago numbers at 61 Americans among the 2,160 moved from Afghanistan when that story was published. A little more than 500 people have been moved out since then. The Task Force Argo website reported May 25 that it has evacuated 2,663 people from Afghanistan but does not state how many were Americans. Even if all of the 500 additional people since Oct. 21 were Americans — and they are not — that would amount to 561 total.Task Force Argo’s first flight on Aug. 30, 2021, brought 400 Afghans out of Afghanistan. On Sept. 24, 2021, the group announced it had collaborated with a group called Save Our Allies to bring ""550 American citizens, lawful permanent residents who have green cards to work in the United States, special immigrant visa holders, Afghans-at-risk, and their families from Afghanistan to a refugee processing center in the Middle East."" The release did not state how many were Americans. An Oct. 8, 2021, news release reported that Task Force Argo evacuated 11 U.S. citizens, eight green card holders, and 85 immediate family members. Two days later, a news release from Task Force Argo and a group called Task Force Sunflower said the two collaborated to evacuate three U.S. citizens, 12 U.S. green card holders and 79 of their immediate family members from Afghanistan. Team America, Save Our Allies, Task Force Sunflower and Task Force Argo are among as many as 180 private groups working privately but collaborating with the U.S. State Department and Defense Department to help bring Americans and Afghans out of Afghanistan. Save Our Allies, for example, has reported bringing more than 12,000 Afghans out of the country. It reported it had paid the costs of bringing 55 American citizens and lawful permanent residents out in December.Featured Fact-checkInstagram postsstated on January 26, 2023 in a videoThe amount the U.S. has spent in Ukraine is “double the U.S. expenditure for its own war in Afghanistan.”By Jeff Cercone • January 27, 2023Other efforts since Aug. 31, 2021, included Project Dynamo and Human First Coalition using a private charter flight to bring more than 100 U.S. citizens and green card holders and nine special immigrant visa holders to the United States in late September, a news release said. Project Dynamo and Human First Coalition said the Taliban helped them have a safe takeoff from Kabul.The State Department press office told PolitiFact Iowa in a series of email exchanges that it cannot confirm how many Americans these non-government organizations have brought out of Afghanistan. The department evaluates requests for privately arranged flights on a case-by-case basis but could not confirm how many passengers on these flights are eligible to be relocated or settled in the United States, the press office wrote. The State Department vets people the private groups bring to the United States for admission but lacks enough personnel to confirm how any passengers registered on a plane manifest are eligible for relocation in this country, the press office said.The State Department has supported directly travel out of Afghanistan for 683 U.S. citizens and 559 lawful permanent residents from Aug. 31, 2021, to May 23, 2022, with no deadline for ending these efforts, the press office reported. Before Aug. 31, U.S. military and the State Department evacuated and relocated 120,000 people, including 10,000 U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents and Afghan interpreters with special immigrant visas.Nunn said in the PolitiFact Iowa interviews he was involved with rescue missions via third party countries that helped remove Americans and Afghans  from Afghanistan last year. He has not been there this year. He works on evacuation logistics remotely, he said. He said he was confident that he had a hand in saving more than 2,000 Americans because of his involvement in last year’s flights, his continued communication and logistical work to assist those who need help getting out of the country, and his collaboration with the national consortium assisting the State Department. ""The real conversation in my opinion needs to be far more about the fact that we left Americans behind,"" Nunn said. ""There still are Americans there right now, and there are people in America helping these folks out of their own pocket, their own time. We would like to have some level of help on this and be able to save the people who served with us for two decades.""A U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee minority report in February suggested that 9,000 Americans were left in Afghanistan when the Taliban took over. The State Department disputes that number, saying fewer than 200 Americans still were there and choosing to stay.U.S. consortium members have weekly conference calls with government officials in continuing moves to help people leave Afghanistan, involved members told PolitiFact in interviews and emails. This private effort has been referred to as a ""digital Dunkirk,"" a reference to the citizens who rushed to Dunkirk in their personal boats to rescue 338,000 British and French soldiers during Germany’s 1940 World War II siege of that French beach town. High-tech evacuation communications and logistics involving safe houses in Afghanistan and assistance from countries like Qatar once people leave Afghanistan are designed to keep Taliban leaders from finding and punishing those trying to leave.Saboe’s Team America eventually merged with another group #AfghanEvac. Shawn Van Diver, #AfghanEvac’s founder and an early leader pulling together the national consortium, said it’s unlikely that 2,000 Americans have needed to be rescued from Afghanistan since U.S. troops left. Americans who want to leave the country now may fly out of a commercial airport, he said.Van Diver said Task Force Argo has been a sincere, valuable partner. He said in a PolitiFact Iowa interview that Nunn and Task Force Argo cofounder Jesse Jensen, an Army Ranger Regiment captain and Republican candidate for Congress from Washington state, have been helpful bucking many in their party by supporting an Afghan Adjustment Act. The act, supported by President Biden, would give Afghan immigrants permanent legal residency and a pathway to U.S. citizenship.""I think it’s clear that these guys care about Afghans,"" Van Diver said. ""Argo has a lot of handlers that talk to a lot of Afghans, and has been doing their best to provide that much needed support. And, you know, they’ve really stepped up.""Our rulingA political ad for Nunn’s 3rd Congressional District primary race in Iowa says Nunn ""saved over 2,000 Americans abandoned in Afghanistan by leading private rescue missions."" Nunn, Argo Task Force co-founder Jesse Jensen and others are key members of several American groups working privately but in collaboration with the U.S. government to bring Americans and endangered people out of Taliban-ruled Afghanistan since U.S. troops left that country. But saying the count is more than 2,000 Americans when most of those coming out are not American gives a different impression of what Nunn is doing than exists. In a May 18 interview on Shenandoah, Iowa’s KMA radio, Nunn, himself, qualified the claim: ""We flew multiple flights over and carried out over 2,500 Americans and allies after the U.S. flag fell in Kabul.""Nunn is doing humanitarian work but the number in the ad is an exaggeration and ignores important details.

76,Jill Terreri,Lee Zeldin “voted for Cuomo’s Billion Dollar Tax hike and every Cuomo budget.”,"Republican gubernatorial candidate Harry Wilson aims to discredit one of the leading candidates in the GOP primary, Rep. Lee Zeldin, with claims that Zeldin supported the economic plans put forth over the years by then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat. Wilson, a businessman from Westchester County, claims in an ad that ""Lee Zeldin was Andrew Cuomo’s favorite Republican."" The ad goes on to say Zeldin ""voted for Cuomo’s Billion Dollar Tax hike and every Cuomo budget."" Primaries for statewide offices are set for June 28. Former Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino and former Trump administration aide Andrew Giuliani are also running in the Republican primary for governor. Zeldin, a Long Island congressman, was elected to the state Senate in 2010 and served two terms. We checked his voting record on every state budget during that time. Each budget was passed in multiple bills, addressing revenue, aid to localities, and debt service among other parts, and lawmakers vote on each of them. Zeldin voted in favor of all of the budget bills during his years in the state Senate. Many of these bills passed with overwhelming support in the Senate, sometimes without any senator voting against them. During this period, Republicans controlled the Senate, at times with support from the Independent Democratic Caucus, and they negotiated with the Assembly’s Democratic leadership and the Cuomo administration.  We asked Wilson’s campaign about his claim that Zeldin voted in favor of a ""billion-dollar tax hike."" Campaign spokesperson Alex Wilkes said that in 2011, Zeldin supported the state budget's $1.9 billion tax increase, (revenue was set to increase by that much, though supporters of the tax reform package would say that rates actually went down) and in 2013 Zeldin voted for the state budget that included an extension of a tax targeting high earners. The tax was set to expire in 2014, but the budget vote in March 2013 extended it until 2017. Some observers, like E.J. McMahon, a close watcher of state finances and a fiscal conservative, called the extension in 2013 a tax increase. The tax on high earners was supposed to end, but Cuomo and the Legislature kept it in place, resulting in a 29% increase for high earners, McMahon said. He reached that figure by calculating what they would have paid had the tax targeting high earners expired and what they paid under the rate established by the plan passed by the lawmakers.Featured Fact-checkAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezstated on January 27, 2023 in an interview with reporters“The largest contributor to the debt ceiling, or to our deficit, has been the Trump tax cuts.”By Louis Jacobson • February 1, 2023Following the tax reform in late 2011, tax receipts were projected to increase by $1.9 billion. According to the Cuomo administration, the budget for the 2013 fiscal year (April 1, 2012, through March 31, 2013,) raised more tax revenue, though it also created savings for the middle class. An April 2012 report from the Cuomo administration projected a $2 billion increase in tax receipts from what was collected in fiscal year 2012 and what it expected to collect in fiscal year 2013. An expected gross increase of $1.9 billion was attributed to ""tax reform.""This reform package lowered rates slightly for the highest earners, but did not bring them down to what they would have been had the higher rates been allowed to expire. The report also projected a $250 million decrease in tax revenue from an MTA payroll tax relief plan for small businesses and a decrease of $135 million from tax credits and other initiatives. Though the tax reforms were a revenue-raiser for the state, the budget division wrote: ""The tax reform measures are intended to enhance fairness in the tax system and are expected to provide $900 million in savings for middle class New Yorkers and small business."" When asked about Wilson’s claim, Zeldin spokesperson Katie Vincentz pointed to the downstate payroll tax break, and a middle-income tax cut, both agreed to as part of the 2011 tax package, and said all of the budgets contained conservative wins. Vincentz also said the budgets shouldn't be called Cuomo budgets, because they were negotiated with and voted on by the Legislature and that members of the Senate majority changed Cuomo’s budget proposals. Our rulingWilson claims Zeldin ""voted for Cuomo’s Billion Dollar Tax hike and every Cuomo budget."" While in the state Senate, Zeldin did vote for a final version of every budget that Cuomo proposed. But calling it ""Cuomo’s budget"" erases the role the state Legislature played in negotiating and making changes to Cuomo’s proposals. The changes to the tax rates were intended to bring in more revenue, though many in the state experienced a tax cut. The highest earners paid a lower rate than they had been paying, but more than they would have paid if the rate had been allowed to expire. The claim is partially accurate because the tax revenue was projected to increase, but it leaves out important details and takes some things out of context, so we rate it Half True.",Harry Wilson,"• May 27,",half-true
77,Samantha Putterman,Studies show plastics can help combat climate change.,"Plastics can help fight climate change?The perplexing statement was recently made on Facebook by America’s Plastic Makers, a U.S. plastics producer that says its mission is to end plastic waste with modern materials.""Studies show #plastic can help combat climate change,"" the post says. ""Researchers found using plastic in packaging and consumer products can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to many alternative materials."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)America’s Plastic Makers is run by the American Chemistry Council, an industry trade association for U.S. chemical companies, and is one of the leading producers of plastic in the U.S. The group’s post links to a page on its website that says decades of analysis shows plastics are strong and lightweight, thus requiring less material than steel, paper, aluminum and glass. The group says that replacing plastics with these materials, in many cases, would ""significantly increase greenhouse gas emissions.""But this oversimplifies a complex issue about plastic packaging's benefits versus its negative impacts on the marine environment and human health.Many studies have found that plastic significantly contributes to climate change because of the high carbon dioxide emissions that occur at every stage of its life. The basics of plasticPlastics are made from raw materials like natural gas, oil or plants, which are refined into ethane and propane before being treated with heat, turning them into ethylene and propylene. These materials combine to create different polymers, which look like powdered laundry detergent. That’s melted down, cooled and eventually molded to make products like water bottles, food packaging, auto parts, medical devices and more.This process — which includes the extraction and transportation of oil and gas, as well as the steps to refine the plastic — emits millions of metric tons of carbon dioxide every year.In its report, America’s Plastic Makers uses various life-cycle studies — a methodology for assessing environmental impacts associated with the different stages of a product, process or service — from 2011, 2016 and 2018. Those studies suggest that plastic can perform the functions of paper or glass, but with less material and less weight, leading to less production energy and greenhouse gases.The benefits of lightweight material are legitimate, but plastics still have negatives. Primarily, American consumers use so much plastic that it still has a large negative impact on the environment. A May 2019 report called ""Plastic & Climate: The Hidden Costs of a Plastic Planet,"" by the Center for International Environmental Law, found that the manufacture of plastics is particularly greenhouse-gas intensive.In 2015, emissions from manufacturing ethylene were 184.3 to 213 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, about as much as what 45 million vehicles emit during one year.Featured Fact-checkInstagram postsstated on January 11, 2023 in an Instagram post“More contraception availability increases abortion demand.""By Samantha Putterman • January 18, 2023Then there’s the repeated disposal of plastic packaging, via landfill, incineration or recycling. Incineration has the largest climate impact. U.S. emissions from plastics incineration in 2015 were 5.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. Because plastics are so common and so easily disposed of, it’s not especially realistic to compare their environmental impact to other materials. ""This topic is indeed more complicated than the (American Plastic Makers) report suggests,"" said Rob Jackson, an earth systems professor at Stanford University. ""I’m reminded of the common question, ‘Paper or plastic?’ The right answer is whatever you already have, so long as you reuse it.""Finally, researchers have found that plastics have a large negative impact on the earth’s oceans.The ocean acts like a huge sink for global pollution, with tons of plastic dumped in waters around the world every year. Hundreds of thousands of marine animals get entangled in plastic waste each year and ingest and suffocate on plastic products they mistake for food.Studies evaluating how plastics impact marine environment and human health acknowledge that the material is cheap, strong and durable, and offers benefits to humanity, but say that waste management practices and human behavior have created a real problem.Plastics do not biodegrade but they do eventually break down under sunlight and fragment into small particles, called microplastics. One 2012 report published in Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology said that 267 species in the marine environment are known to have been harmed by plastic entanglement or ingestion.Scientists suspect that ocean pollution is an important but insufficiently understood component of global pollution that poses serious threats to human health and well-being.Matthew Kastner, director of media relations for the Chemistry Council’s plastics division, acknowledged the danger of ocean pollution but also said the press has made exaggerated claims about plastics and greenhouse gas emissions.""This is a short social media post intended to help correct the record,"" Kastner told PolitiFact. ""We 100% agree that plastics do not belong in the ocean or anywhere in the environment.""All this presents a complicated choice in terms of deciding what to choose for packaging, researchers say.""What is clear is that we need to reduce plastics production while ensuring that any alternatives do not contribute more to climate change, and this is where recycling comes in,"" a 2020 analysis by the Imperial College of London says. ""The emissions reductions from eliminating the need for new plastic outweigh the slightly higher emissions that come from processing wastes to recover plastics.""Our rulingAmerica’s Plastic Makers claimed on Facebook that plastic can help combat climate change.It’s true that some studies have found that plastic packaging is less environmentally damaging than alternatives like glass and paper, but this doesn’t negate plastics' negative impact on human health and marine environment. Instead of assessing which packaging to use, researchers said the focus should be on ramping up recycling and reuse practices.The topic is more complicated than the post suggests.

As images roll showing crime scene tape, sad children and a hand that appears to be wet with blood, a narrator says:""They were victims of violent crimes like murder and molestation and Chief Justice Cheri Beasley failed to protect them. ""The murderer who shot a boy in the face? Beasley vacated his death sentence. ""The man convicted of sexually assaulting a seven year old girl? She threw out the indictment. And that's just the beginning. ""We can't trust Cheri Beasley to protect our families.""The ad includes some elements of truth about Beasley’s actions while she was a justice on the seven-member North Carolina Supreme Court, but omits context about the cases that might give viewers a skewed impression of why Beasley ruled the way she did. Asked about the ad, NRSC spokesman T.W. Arrighi sent an email with internet links to the court case opinions and news stories about them and wrote: ""Every claim is backed up."" He didn’t offer additional comments.Let’s review the claims.Vacated death sentenceThe ad says Beasley vacated the death sentence of a man who shot a boy in the face, citing a state Supreme Court ruling from August 2020. There’s some accuracy to this claim, but it’s also a little misleading and leaves out a lot of context.The case was the State of North Carolina v. Marcus Reymond Robinson. Robinson had been taken off of death row and given a life sentence and the state Supreme Court was asked to weigh whether a new law required Robinson to be returned to death row. Robinson was given a death sentence in 1994 after a jury found him guilty of murdering 17-year-old Erik Tornblom by shooting Tornblom in the face with a sawed-off shotgun after he agreed to give Robinson a ride in his car, according to court documents.But in 2012, the case was reexamined under North Carolina’s Racial Justice Act, a 2009 law that allowed death row inmates and capital murder defendants to challenge their sentences on grounds that they were influenced by racial bias. A Superior Court judge commuted Robinson’s sentence to life in prison after finding that racism significantly influenced jury selection in the 1994 murder trial.Then in 2013, after Republicans had gained control of the state legislature, they repealed the Racial Justice Act and attempted to apply it retroactively, claiming cases already heard under the law were voided and all pending cases were dismissed.This is where Beasley and the state Supreme Court come in. The court ruled 4-3 that Robinson could not be sent back to death row because it would violate the double-jeopardy protections of the state and federal constitutions, and Beasley wrote the majority’s opinion. At the time, the court had six Democrats and one Republican. Dissenting were two Democrats and the lone Republican.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 26, 2023 in a postThe officers who beat Tyre Nichols targeted him because he was “allegedly dating” one of their wives.By Madison Czopek • February 1, 2023The ad says Beasley vacated Robinson’s sentence. To be clear, Beasley’s ruling had no bearing on the man’s freedom. He remains in prison.‘Threw out the indictment’The ad says Beasley ""threw out the indictment"" of a man convicted of sexually assaulting a 7-year-old girl. This claim, like the other, has an element of truth but omits key facts.The case was the State of North Carolina v. Michael Lee White. White was found guilty in 2015 of committing a sex offense against a 7-year-old. White appealed his conviction on grounds that the indictment used to convict him failed to include identifying information about the victim as required by state law, which says this about indictments for sex offenses:""If the victim is a person under the age of 13 years, it is sufficient to allege that thedefendant unlawfully, willfully, and feloniously did engage in a sex offense with a child under the age of 13 years, naming the child, and concluding as required by law.""White’s indictment listed the child as ""Victim #1."" The state Supreme Court, including Beasley, was asked to review White’s case and the decision by the state Court of Appeals, which had upheld his conviction because the victim’s identity appeared in other court documents.In May 2019, the state Supreme Court ruled 4-2, with Beasley in the majority, that White’s trial court judgment should be vacated because prosecutors didn’t comply with state law. The decision featured one less vote because Justice Mark Davis, who sat on the Court of Appeals before joining the Supreme Court, didn’t participate in the case.Beasley wrote the majority opinion, arguing that prosecutors didn’t meet the standard of the law required for indictments. ""The State concedes that its intent was to conceal the identity of the child — an intent at odds with the purpose of the naming requirement: to provide notice of the essential elements of the crime charged to the accused,"" she wrote. ""The statutory language is clear and unambiguous: it requires that the child be named as part of the allegations in the indictment … The phrase ‘Victim #1’ does not distinguish this victim from other children or victims.""White served about three years and nine months in prison before being released in June 2019, records show.North Carolina Lawyers Weekly reported on the decision, as did the Carolina Journal, a publication of the conservative John Locke Foundation think tank. The Journal predicted Beasley’s ruling would someday come up on the campaign trail.Our rulingThe ad alleges that Cheri Beasley ""failed to protect"" victims by vacating a man’s death sentence and throwing out another convicted man’s indictment for assaulting a minor.In the death sentence case, Beasley did rule against sending Robinson to death row. But the ad leaves out two key facts: he had already been taken off death row, and her ruling kept in place a life sentence. So it’s misleading to suggest that victims aren’t protected from a man who remains behind bars.In the case with the minor, the ad accurately states that Beasley ruled in favor of throwing out the defendant’s indictment. It leaves out the argument of Beasley and the majority of the court: that prosecutors failed to comply with state law when indicting the man involved.The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

In 2020, he launched Narya Capital, and since then, the firm has funded a handful of startups, primarily in health care and food supply. In 2021, Narya played the lead role in assembling a group of investors to help Rumble expand.Rumble is a video-sharing platform, created in 2013 by a Toronto entrepreneur to compete with YouTube. Like YouTube, the more people who come to Rumble, the more advertising revenue it attracts. Rumble drew attention in 2020, when it became popular among conservatives for what it promoted as its hands-off approach to moderating content. ""Rumble’s mission is to restore the Internet to its roots by making it free and open once again,"" the company said in March.Rumble’s CEO said recently it has yet to turn a profit, but it is growing rapidly.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 5, 2023 in a Facebook postMark Zuckerberg launched a platform last month ""that allows each user to earn from $500 a day without even leaving home.""By Ciara O'Rourke • February 8, 2023When former President Donald Trump and conservative pundits such as Dan Bongino and Steve Bannon began posting their videos on Rumble, its user numbers soared. The company reported an average of 41 million monthly active users (people who visit the site) in the first quarter of 2022. In 2020, the level was closer to 1 million users a month.Vance personally invested in Rumble. In his April 2022 candidate financial disclosure, he reported holdings in the company that fall in the range of $115,000 to $300,000. His investment was part of a larger package assembled by Narya that included billionaire Peter Thiel, now a leading backer of Vance’s Senate campaign. The details were undisclosed, but as part of the deal, a top Narya partner joined Rumble’s board. How Russian sponsored media came to RumbleAfter Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in February, YouTube banned the Russia state-affiliated media outlet RT — formerly Russia Today — from its platform. In response, Rumble became RT’s primary video platform. Ryan’s campaign noted RT’s move as evidence for its claim that Vance is profiting from Russian propaganda.Scott Radnitz, a specialist in Russia and Eurasian studies at the University of Washington, said RT is largely a propaganda network.""Some of its content is non-political, but it is backed by the state and much of its content reflects the Kremlin's messaging intended for foreign audiences,"" Radnitz said. ""RT's use as a mouthpiece of the state has been especially evident during the war, as it has echoed the Kremlin's distortions, lies, and conspiracy theories.""When Russian state media said that dead people found in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha were a hoax, RT amplified that message to non-Russian speaking audiences.Since March, RT has used Rumble to post its ongoing livestream along with individual video news stories. The livestream has accumulated over 2 million views since its launch. The video stories have much lower numbers. The most popular ones have about 14,000 views.Other Russian state-sponsored programs have also joined Rumble. They have lower viewer stats than RT.Calculating whether Vance profits off RumbleA key part of Rumble’s business plan is to increase its audience, and with that, its advertising revenues. RT and other Russian state-sponsored programs bring viewers to Rumble. Tech investor Roger McNamee was an early backer of Facebook. Today, on top of his investment work, he’s part of a campaign to crack down on hate speech on Facebook, Twitter and other platforms. McNamee said that while RT’s viewership is less than a million a month, that still helps Rumble’s bottom line.""The choice by Rumble to stream RT after it had been blocked by YouTube is an unambiguous play for viewers who engage with Russian propaganda,"" McNamee said. ""What matters is the intent of Rumble and the fact that RT generates millions of streams on the platform.""Many of Rumble’s financial details remain private, but as a general rule, rising user numbers increase the company’s value, and to that extent, the investment Vance made in 2021 is, on paper at least, worth more today.RT has boosted those viewership numbers, but it is far from the most popular producer on Rumble. Bongino’s show, for example, regularly draws about 150,000 views for a single episode, and one of his shows in September had over 973,000 views.Rumble benefits from RT’s presence, but it doesn’t depend on it.Our rulingRyan said, ""Vance profits off Russia propaganda.""Ryan’s claim is based on Vance’s investment in Rumble, the platform where RT posts its videos.RT amplifies Kremlin messaging, and in the past two and a half months, RT has produced nearly 2 million views on Rumble. More views mean more advertising revenues for Rumble, and RT’s presence adds value to Vance’s investment.But other programs on Rumble attract many more viewers, and the details on Vance’s investment in the company are not public. Rumble’s CEO earlier this year ​​said the company has yet to turn a profit.With that caveat in mind, we rate this claim Half True.",Tim Ryan,"May 24, 2022",half-true

83,Laura Schulte,"“Title 42 has fueled the border crisis. In 2019, 7 percent of illegal border crossings were repeated crossings. Today the rate is 27 percent.”","Title 42 has become a hot topic, as the number of migrants crossing the U.S. southern border has risen. The policy was enacted in 2020 under President Donald Trump in hopes of stopping the spread of COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic by sending people immediately back to their home countries.The policy was to be lifted at the end of May 2022, but now faces uncertainty, including the prospect of legal challenges and a push from Republicans who want President Joe Biden to keep the controversial immigration program in place to stem a surge at the border. Tom Nelson, a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in Wisconsin, weighed in with an alternative view — that Title 42 is a cause of the crisis, not a solution for it. ""Title 42 has fueled the border crisis,"" he said on April 26, 2022. ""In 2019, 7 percent of illegal border crossings were repeated crossings. Today the rate is 27 percent."" Is it true that the percentage of repeat crossings has nearly quadrupled, fueling the border  crisis? Let’s take a closer look. More about Title 42 Title 42 stems from a 1944 public health law aimed at preventing the spread of communicable diseases, according to an April 7, 2022 article from Voice of America. It allows border enforcement agencies to remove migrants crossing into the United States, including those in search of asylum. That part is important, because migrants who reach the U.S. ordinarily have the right to apply for asylum if they can cite a credible fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social class in their home country.In practice, once instituted by Trump, Title 42 allowed agents to send migrants who cross  the border back to Mexico within hours, or to another country of origin within a few days, without any immigration hearing process taking place. Those crossing the border never faced legal consequences for crossing, which would typically disincentivize people from recrossing the border after being removed from the U.S. The situation at the borderSo is Title 42 fueling the immigration crisis? The Voice of America article noted that Title 42 created a ""significant increase"" in the number of repeat crossings, because people who were expelled simply tried to cross again. When we asked Nelson’s team for backup for his claim, they shared testimony from an April 6, 2022 meeting of a U.S. House subcommittee focused on border security that made the same point.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 18, 2023 in a Facebook postDocument shows that Hunter Biden paid Joe Biden $50,000 a month in rent.By Samantha Putterman • January 19, 2023Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior policy counsel for the American Immigration Council, testified that in fiscal year 2019, only 7% of people encountered at the border had previously crossed that year. But in the two years following the implementation of Title 42, that number jumped to 27%. ""This is due in large part to the fact that under Title 42, individuals expelled back to Mexico are not subject to any collateral consequence,"" Reichlin-Melnick said. ""This lack of collateral consequences (other than the inherent risk of death in the journey), combined with the desperation and insecurity faced by people waiting at the border for the asylum process to restart, strongly incentivizes many migrants expelled under Title 42 to try again.""Collateral consequences for people crossing the border, he said later in his testimony, could include no opportunity to appeal immigration decisions, and no process to challenge a decision to expel someone from the U.S. after they cross the border. Basically, because more people were being expelled from the U.S. without those consequences, they weren’t entered into Border Patrols databases, and therefore were free to try and cross again with no previously logged history. The number of people being turned away since March 2020 supports that. According to an April 27, 2022, report from the Pew Research Center, about 2.9 million encounters were logged between April 2020 and March 2022. Nearly 1.8 million of those encounters, or 61%, resulted in migrants being expelled from the U.S. under Title 42.The remaining 1.1 million were apprehended under an existing immigration policy at the border, allowing them to stay within the country under a claim of asylum and a requirement to attend immigration court. Most of the people who made it into the U.S. under asylum claims since March 2020 have been unaccompanied children and migrant families with children. But just because the number of re-crossings are high doesn’t mean that is the only thing driving high numbers of people crossing the southern border. According to an April 28, 2020, New York Times article, the number of migrants crossing the border is growing. In March, more than 221,000 people crossed the border, the highest for a single month in decades. Another New York Times article, published in October 2021, suggests the high number of crossings is likely being driven by the pandemic response in migrants’ home countries, natural disasters and a lack of jobs.So, although Title 42 may be prompting more repeat crossing attempts, inflating the numbers, there are still deeper, fundamental reasons for the surge at the border.Our rulingNelson claimed ""Title 42 has fueled the border crisis. In 2019, 7 percent of illegal border crossings were repeated crossings. Today the rate is 27 percent.""The numbers are on target, and repeated crossing attempts under Title 42 have undoubtedly increased, which inflates the numbers. The lack of repercussions means there is little incentive to not try again.However, more people are trying to come into the U.S. based on other reasons, typically related to their home country. That leaves a claim that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.We rate it Half True.    window.gciAnalyticsUAID = 'PMJS-TEALIUM-COBRAND';window.gciAnalyticsLoadEvents = false;window.gciAnalytics.view({    'event-type': 'pageview',    'content-type': 'interactives',    'content-ssts-section': 'news',    'content-ssts-subsection': 'news:politics',    'content-ssts-topic': 'news:politics:politifactwisconsin',    'content-ssts-subtopic': ' news:politics:politifactwisconsin'});",Tom Nelson,"May 17, 2022",half-true

""This is the real crisis: It costs more to live in many Florida cities than New York City.""  Florida residents are struggling against the backdrop of rising rental prices, explosive demand and limited supply. But are rents as steep as Crist made it seem? It’s a bit more complicated than his comparison suggests.Most Florida cities are less expensive than New York City The cost of living in Florida has risen significantly since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Rent prices have particularly skyrocketed from West Palm Beach to Miami, according to data maintained by Realtor.com. Realtor.com published a report in March indicating that the median rent in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach area increased about 57% in the last year. The report examined 50 ""core-based statistical areas,"" meaning geographic regions drafted by the White House Office of Management and Budget that often consist of two or more socioeconomically-tied counties.South Florida, with a median rent of $2,988 a month, outpaced New York City’s median rent of $2,750 in March, per the report. The tri-county region also experienced growth at a faster year-over-year pace than New York City. Other large metro areas in Florida, however, lagged behind New York City in median rent. For example, the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater area had a median rent of $2,114 a month, an annual increase of around 30%.The median rent price in Jacksonville was $1,580, and the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford area was $1,886.So, New York’s median rent is actually higher than most Florida cities. When looking at for-sale home prices, New York City’s median asking price is also more expensive. ""From the standpoint of actual rents and property prices, the New York metro remains one of the most expensive metros in the country,"" said Ken Johnson, a real estate economist and dean of Florida Atlantic University’s College of Business. Featured Fact-checkRon DeSantisstated on January 17, 2023 in a press conference""Almost every study now has said with these new boosters, you're more likely to get infected with the bivalent booster.""By Yacob Reyes • January 20, 2023Florida’s rental and ownership premiums outpace New York CityCrist's characterization is more accurate from the standpoint of rental and ownership premiums, or the percentage difference between the statistically estimated prices of a metro area and its current prices. Real estate economists measure rental and ownership premiums to assist consumers in gauging whether their current market is over or underpriced. Researchers from Florida Atlantic University, Florida Gulf Coast University and the University of Alabama analyzed large rental markets across the U.S. and developed a ranking of the most overpriced areas. Of the 25 most overvalued rental markets in the nation, the highest five are all in Florida. ""Six months ago, only a couple of Florida metros could be found in the Top 25 of this ranking,"" Johnson told PolitiFact. ""Thus, Florida markets appear to be rising through this ranking very quickly.""The research showed the residents living in Miami-Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Tampa, North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton and Port St. Lucie are paying rent that is overpriced. In Miami-Fort Lauderdale, for example, renters are paying around 21% more than what they should be, based on the area’s long-term trends. That is the most overvalued market in Florida.Meanwhile, New York City wasn’t featured on the list. According to another study measuring more than 100 U.S. rental markets, New York City ranked 98th. ""In terms of a premium, the New York metro is one of the least expensive metros in the country,"" Johnson said. Our rulingCrist said, ""It costs more to live in many Florida cities than New York City.""  PolitiFact found that the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach area’s median rent exceeded New York City's. However, while Florida cities have experienced record growth, their median rental prices still lag behind New York City.Crist has more of a point when it comes to rental and ownership premiums.

85,Jon Greenberg,“We’re one of the seven nations in the world that allow abortion on demand at 20 weeks.”,"In an interview on Fox News, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said the U.S. is unusually permissive on abortion relative to the rest of the world.""We’re one of the seven nations in the world that allow abortion on demand at 20 weeks,"" Graham said May 8 on ""Fox News Sunday.""Graham spokesman Kevin Bishop told PolitiFact that group included China and North Korea, adding that ""the United States should not be in that club.""The group also includes countries, such as Canada, the Netherlands, South Korea and New Zealand. But before we dig into the details, Graham’s phrase, ""abortion on demand,"" opens the door to adding more countries to the list. Particularly in Europe, broad exceptions allow women to get an abortion at up to 20 to 24 weeks.Graham’s statistic traces back to a 2014 report by the Charlotte Lozier Institute, a research group that opposes abortion. The countries flagged in the Lozier report are: the United States, China, North Korea, Canada, the Netherlands, Vietnam and Singapore. The Lozier study included countries if their laws failed to specify the allowed reasons for an abortion — the woman's well-being, for example — and permitted abortions at 20 weeks or later in the pregnancy. In a footnote, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito referred to the report in his leaked draft opinion, which would overturn the 1973 landmark case Roe v. Wade. The footnote also cited data from the Center for Reproductive Rights, a group that supports abortion rights, and added Iceland and Guinea-Bissau to the list because they ""are now also similarly permissive."" Margaret Harpin, a legal adviser for the Center for Reproductive Rights, told PolitiFact that by their count, 12 countries now allow abortions up to 20 weeks or later without specifying a particular reason for seeking one.Graham’s reference to seven nations tracks with the 2014 Lozier study, but since then, laws have changed and that number has increased to 12. Beyond that, PolitiFact’s analysis found that there are more nations that allow abortions at or beyond the 20-week mark. They do so on the basis of socioeconomic welfare or mental health.Graham cast the U.S. as an outlier, but Fordham University law professor Julie Suk said international comparisons are challenging. ""Many Americans use the term ‘abortion on demand’ in a way that would encompass ‘medically indicated abortion’ in Europe,"" Suk said. ""So the comparison of abortion here and abortion in Europe gets very sloppy and confused.""(The challenge of international comparisons has led to different PolitiFact ratings over the years, with most finding that claims like Graham’s leave out important context.)Reasons why other countries allow abortions beyond 20 weeks Under current U.S. Supreme Court rulings, a woman has the right to an abortion up to the point of viability of the fetus. No exact minimum number of weeks defines when a fetus can survive outside the womb. The most premature infant that has survived in the U.S. was born at about 21 weeks. Once a fetus is viable, states can ban abortion, so long as the mother's life or health isn’t at risk. Featured Fact-checkInstagram posts stated on January 11, 2023 in an Instagram post“More contraception availability increases abortion demand.""By Samantha Putterman • January 18, 2023In over 20 countries, family circumstances or mental health are grounds for an abortion at 20 weeks or later. In Australia, laws vary by state or territory, but the three largest states permit abortions at 22 to 24 weeks.Japan allows abortions up to 22 weeks for socioeconomic reasons. In South Africa, abortions based on socioeconomic factors are allowed up to 20 weeks. Rwanda allows abortions on broad socioeconomic grounds until 22 weeks.Our scan of laws across Europe found 18 countries extend the allowable number of weeks to get an abortion based on the mental health of the mother or socioeconomic concerns. In the Czech Republic, an abortion can take place up to week 20 for mental health reasons. In Ukraine, the law gives flexibility up to the 22nd week. Great Britain allows abortion until 24 weeks of pregnancy if continuation of the pregnancy involves risk ""of injury to physical or mental health"" of the patient or any of her existing children. Northeastern University law professor Martha Davis has spoken with legal experts across Europe about the ease of accessing abortions at 20 weeks or later.""Folks from places like Denmark, Sweden, England, and others with similar laws said that it was a non-issue to meet the paper requirements to obtain a later term abortion,"" Davis said.Law professor Federico Fabbrini at Dublin City University said that a woman’s request carries weight and in the U.K., ""medical approval of an abortion request is a matter of course,"" at up to 24 weeks in pregnancy. Access to abortion in other countries not based purely on individual rights The U.S. and other countries view abortion law through different lenses. In Europe and elsewhere, a woman’s right to choose is less at the center of these laws than Americans might think.""None of the countries that the U.S. considers to be its peers recognize a constitutional right to terminate pregnancy, as a matter of private choice, for any reason, up until the moment of fetal viability,"" wrote Suk of Fordham in a forthcoming William and Mary Law Review article.It’s less about individual rights, Suk said, and more about defining the terms of what will lead to the best outcome for both the country and the person who is pregnant and their family.A de facto three-phase approach has emerged. In the first phase, the state imposes few limits on abortions up to about 11 to 14 weeks.""Between early pregnancy and approaching the viability line — anywhere from 20 to 28 weeks — the law imposes procedural hurdles for permitted abortions,"" Suk wrote.After that, the law might or might not explicitly ban abortions, but in either case, they are rare and only occur in immediate life-threatening circumstances. Our rulingGraham said that the U.S. is one of ""seven nations in the world that allow abortion on demand at 20 weeks.""This is based on a 2014 study from a center that opposes abortion rights; the study highlighted countries that allow abortions at 20 weeks or later in a pregnancy and whose laws did not spell out under what circumstances abortions are permitted.Since that study, five additional countries now meet those criteria.

86,Louis Jacobson,"“My Treasury Department is planning to pay down the national debt this quarter, which never happened under my predecessor.”","Amid public concerns about high inflation rates, President Joe Biden sought to reassure Americans that his administration had a handle on the economy.One of the positive signs, Biden said, was that under his administration, the federal government was poised to pay down a portion of the $23.8 trillion federal debt for the first time in several years.""My Treasury Department is planning to pay down the national debt this quarter, which never happened under my predecessor,"" Biden said at the White House on May 10. ""Not once. Not once.""The Treasury Department has said it’s planning to make a modest debt-reduction outlay in the second quarter of 2022, but when looked at in context, this paydown isn’t the notable fiscal turnaround that Biden implies. The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.In a memo released May 2, Treasury announced that it intends to pay down $26 billion in debt during 2022's second quarter. This is typically accomplished by paying off outstanding Treasury securities so the government doesn’t have to keep paying interest.The last time the government paid down the debt was in the second quarter of 2016, under President Barack Obama. This means that under President Donald Trump, the Treasury did not pay down the debt in any quarter. But there are some important bits of context that Biden left out.One is that the same Treasury memo that announced the upcoming debt pay-down noted that during the first quarter of 2022, the government needed to borrow $668 billion, and during the third quarter of 2022, it expects to borrow $182 billion.In other words, the modest paydown in the second quarter would be overwhelmed by the new borrowing during the first and third quarters — complicating the point Biden was trying to make about fiscal responsibility.Featured Fact-checkAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezstated on January 27, 2023 in an interview with reporters“The largest contributor to the debt ceiling, or to our deficit, has been the Trump tax cuts.”By Louis Jacobson • February 1, 2023Biden is also wrong that the Trump administration was never ""planning"" to pay down debt. On Feb. 3, 2020, the Trump administration announced that in the second quarter of 2020, it was planning to pay down $56 billion of debt. Of course, that was a few weeks before the coronavirus pandemic reached the U.S. The debt payment never happened.At the moment, both Biden and Trump are in the same position: They’ve announced a paydown but haven’t yet completed it; events could still intervene. So, at least for now, the two presidents are roughly in the same boat.It’s also worth noting that the planned and actual paydowns cited here have all occurred during the second quarter of the year. That’s not a coincidence.Typically, the federal government is flush with cash in the second quarter, thanks to tax payments made around the tax-deadline time of April 15. So, if any quarter is going to provide the government with some extra cash to pay down the debt, it’s the second quarter. ""Not every second quarter are we able to pay down the debt, but the most likely quarter to do it is the second quarter,"" said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.Having a second-quarter debt paydown doesn’t mean that the government will be able to do similar paydowns in the succeeding three quarters. In recent history, it hasn’t been able to.Our rulingBiden said, ""My Treasury Department is planning to pay down the national debt this quarter, which never happened under my predecessor.""The Treasury has announced its intention to pay down $26 billion in debt during the second quarter of 2022. However, the federal government’s planned paydown during the second quarter — when the government is flush with tax payments — will be swamped by new borrowing during the other three quarters of the year.The Trump administration was also ""planning"" to pay down the debt during the second quarter of 2020 but was stymied by the emergence of the coronavirus pandemic. We rate the statement Half True.",Joe Biden,"May 13, 2022",half-true
87,Madeline Heim,"Says Gov. Tony Evers ""wanted to increase your taxes by $1 billion just for heating your homes. Instead, Republicans cut your taxes by more than $2 billion.""","Come Tax Day in April, Wisconsin GOP lawmakers were eager to remind their constituents what they’d done for them in the most recent state budget. Several took to Twitter to praise the tax cut at the heart of the most recent Republican-written budget, including Rep. John Macco, R-Ledgeview. But he did so with a twist. ""In honor of #TaxDay, I remind you that Governor Evers wanted to increase your taxes by $1 billion just for heating your homes,"" he tweeted April 18, 2022. ""Instead, Republicans cut your taxes by more than $2 billion."" We’ve rated a few similar iterations of this claim, and generally, they’ve checked out. But what does heating have to do with it? Not a lot, it turns out. Most of claim on track, but ""heating homes"" comment isn’t  Macco is correct that Evers, a Democrat, sought to raise taxes by $1 billion. A caveat: The governor proposed a net increase of about $1 billion with his plan that would have raised taxes on businesses and the wealthy while providing tax breaks to lower and middle classes. Still, an increase is an increase. PolitiFact Wisconsin rated that claim True on April 6, 2021.He’s also right that Republicans were able to deliver a more than $2 billion tax cut — the largest in state history. Another caveat there: Between the time when Evers released his budget plan and when the Republicans passed theirs, state officials found out Wisconsin would take in $4.4 billion more in additional tax collections than previously anticipated. That’s a lot of money that Evers didn’t have available to him when he wrote his budget proposal. And, important to note, Evers signed the budget, which was needed to put the cut in effect.Featured Fact-checkAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezstated on January 27, 2023 in an interview with reporters“The largest contributor to the debt ceiling, or to our deficit, has been the Trump tax cuts.”By Louis Jacobson • February 1, 2023But again, the Republican-written budget did deliver the tax cut. In September 2021, we rated Mostly True this claim, from state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills: ""Evers wanted to raise your taxes by $1 billion in a pandemic. Republicans stopped him and delivered the largest tax CUT in state history.""So what does heating residents’ homes have to do with Evers’ plan to raise taxes? We tried to reach Macco to ask him precisely what he was getting at, but his office did not respond to multiple requests for comment. In a scan of the governor’s proposed budget, it appears he may have been referring to Evers’ plan to increase the amount of revenue that utilities would contribute to the Focus on Energy program, bringing in an additional $100 million.Even so, Macco makes it sound like Evers’ entire plan for tax increases rested on that. In reality, the governor sought to increase taxes using other measures, like scaling back a law that allows manufacturers to avoid paying state income taxes and increasing taxes on capital gains for people who earn $400,000 a year or more. That part of the claim clearly misses the mark. Our ruling Macco claimed that Evers wanted to increase Wisconsinites’ taxes by $1 billion ""just for heating your homes,"" but instead, Republicans delivered a more than $2 billion tax cut. The general thrust of the claim is accurate, and similar to claims PolitiFact Wisconsin has rated in the past. But his comment about heating homes doesn’t fit. Our definition for Half True is a statement that is ""partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.""That fits here. window.gciAnalyticsUAID = 'PMJS-TEALIUM-COBRAND';window.gciAnalyticsLoadEvents = false;window.gciAnalytics.view({    'event-type': 'pageview',    'content-type': 'interactives',    'content-ssts-section': 'news',    'content-ssts-subsection': 'news:politics',    'content-ssts-topic': 'news:politics:politifactwisconsin',    'content-ssts-subtopic': ' news:politics:politifactwisconsin'});",John Macco,"May 6, 2022",half-true
88,Vanessa Swales,"""Ron Johnson pushed through a special tax loophole that benefited his own family's business … Then he cashed out of the company for $5 million … (he has) doubled his wealth since taking office.""","As a two-term incumbent, Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin has a record to run on – and to run against. In addition to Democratic contenders, a series of opposition groups are mining that record to make the case against Johnson.Into that fray comes Opportunity Wisconsin, which describes itself as representing Wisconsin residents in the fight for economic equity. The group launched a TV ad in February that opens with the words ""Dereliction of Duty"" on the screen, and features a man identified only as ""William B."" a U.S. Air Force veteran. Speaking to the camera, the man lays out a three-part claim, complete with footnotes on the screen:""Ron Johnson pushed through a special tax loophole that benefited his own family's business … Then he cashed out of the company for $5 million … (he has) doubled his wealth since taking office.""It appears as a simple string of interconnected facts, all based on past reporting. But it comes with its own series of caveats and asterisks that muddy the truth of the claim.Tax relief benefits Johnson’s business (and others, too)Let’s start with the first part of the claim – the ""tax loophole"" – and rewind back to 2017. That's when former President Donald Trump proposed a tax overhaul that included a reduction in the corporate tax rate and a repeal of the requirement that all U.S. citizens have health insurance. To get the measure through the Senate, Trump needed the full support of Republicans, but Johnson announced he would not back the measure. Johnson insisted that the measure include a tax break for so-called ""pass-through"" companies – those that pass all their income on to the owners or investors. Companies structured this way (often small, family owned businesses) are not subject to corporate income tax.In the end, the provision was added to the package, and it passed the Senate with Johnson’s support.To be sure, Johnson’s family-owned business fell into that pass-through category, as did those of many key supporters. Nevertheless, Opportunity Wisconsin missteps when it calls the change a ""loophole"" – the change was well-publicized at the time. And the group mischaracterizes the situation when it suggests the primary beneficiary was Johnson and his family.Indeed, of the 26 million businesses in the nation in 2014, 95 percent were pass-throughs, according to a May 15, 2017 article published by the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank.But, even that asterisk warrants a footnote.A ProPublica investigation, published Aug. 11, 2021, found ""that Johnson’s last-minute maneuver benefited two families more than almost any others in the country — both worth billions and both among the senator’s biggest donors.""The article noted: ""Dick and Liz Uihlein of packaging giant Uline, along with roofing magnate Diane Hendricks, together had contributed around $20 million to groups backing Johnson’s 2016 reelection campaign.""Finally, in a recording obtained by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, in which Johnson addressed a group of donors on April 8, 2022 in Medford, Johnson acknowledged that he and others benefitted, framing it this way:  Featured Fact-checkAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezstated on January 27, 2023 in an interview with reporters“The largest contributor to the debt ceiling, or to our deficit, has been the Trump tax cuts.”By Louis Jacobson • February 1, 2023""Now, did my business benefit? Sure. Did some of my donor businesses? Sure. When you give tax relief to everybody, everybody benefits."" Johnson did sell his business for at least $5 millionThis part of the claim, on the sale of the business, is the most straightforward.Johnson’s family-run company – Pacur LLC, an Oshkosh-based plastics company – was created by Johnson along with his brother-in-law in 1979. Johnson was CEO of Pacur LLC until he was elected to the Senate in 2010. He sold his interest in the company to Gryphon Investors in 2020 for between $5 million and $20 million, according to federal disclosure reports, which only provide a range. He acknowledged he was in talks about a deal to sell as late as 2018 – so, after the tax measure passed the Senate.The $5 million cited by Opportunity Wisconsin is on the low-end of the range. The actual sale price is unknown, as Johnson is not required to disclose it.Johnson’s wealth more than doubled – but over different timeframeFor the final part of the statement – on Johnson’s wealth doubling – Opportunity Wisconsin said it based its calculations of Johnson’s wealth on the methodology used by OpenSecrets, the Congressional Integrity Project and NBC News.Here’s how we broke down those numbers:When Johnson was elected in November 2010, his financial disclosure forms showed assets of between $17,062,029 and $76,836,000. The midpoint of that range is $46,949,015. In 2011, when Johnson took office, his disclosures showed assets (with no liabilities) totaling between $8,767,016 and $38,743,000. The midpoint of that range is $23,755,008.So, a lot depends on the starting point. Fast forward to his 2020 disclosure. In it Johnson’s net worth totalled between $16,951,012 and $79,117,002, with a midpoint of $48,034,007.This means Johnson more than doubled his wealth. The disclosure forms only provide a range, so precise figures cannot be obtained. But, in any case, Johnson does not dispute it.Johnson told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: ""When I got elected, I took all my marketable securities (and) I turned them into cash. I’ve just been sitting on cash. The reason my wealth doubled is I finally sold my business. I cashed out on that. … I sat on cash, I'm still sitting on cash.""Johnson also noted that since he took office, that Standard & Poors 500 Index nearly quadrupled.""I knew during the COVID recession, this is a really good time to invest (in) the stock market. I didn't,"" he said. ""I should have increased my wealth 3.8 times."" Our rulingOpportunity Wisconsin claimed ""Ron Johnson pushed through a special tax loophole that benefited his own family's business … Then he cashed out of the company for $5 million … (he has) doubled his wealth since taking office.""The change benefitted his business – but also applied to tens of millions of other businesses. And it was hardly a loophole, if it was widely discussed publicly. He did sell his company for at least $5 million, but the doubling of wealth deserves more context: In that period, the S&P Index nearly quadrupled.So, the overall claim is a mixed bag – it’s partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.That’s our definition for Half True.  window.gciAnalyticsUAID = 'PMJS-TEALIUM-COBRAND';window.gciAnalyticsLoadEvents = false;window.gciAnalytics.view({    'event-type': 'pageview',    'content-type': 'interactives',    'content-ssts-section': 'news',    'content-ssts-subsection': 'news:politics',    'content-ssts-topic': 'news:politics:politifactwisconsin',    'content-ssts-subtopic': ' news:politics:politifactwisconsin'});",Opportunity Wisconsin,"April 27, 2022",half-true
89,Paul Specht,“Most Americans favor keeping Title 42 in place.”,"A North Carolina senator says President Biden is on the verge of ending an immigration-related pandemic policy that most Americans support.The Biden administration recently announced plans to lift what’s known as Title 42, a public health law that allows border officials to expel certain immigrants without giving them a chance to apply for asylum. Unaccompanied children and some others are exempt from the rule.Title 42 has been controversial since former President Donald Trump enacted it at the start of the pandemic in 2020. Critics of the rule say it’s inherently xenophobic, while supporters see it as a tool that’s necessary for managing both the coronavirus and the influx of immigrants at the southern U.S. border.U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., says he’s working with other Republicans to try to keep Title 42 in place after the Biden administration’s May 23 expiration date. In an April 7 press release with U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Tillis claimed that Biden’s decision is out of step with voters’ priorities. ""Most Americans favor keeping Title 42 in place, so I hope we can agree that we should maintain this policy and protect our country from a surge of illegal immigration over the next few months,"" Tillis said in the press release.Is it true that ""most Americans"" want to keep Title 42 in place?Polling by Morning Consult and Politico suggests Title 42 might be popular, but polling experts say it’s difficult to make declarative statements about the law without more data. A separate poll conducted by an immigrant rights group found support for Biden’s position, but experts said it had its own shortcomings.Morning Consult pollTo support Tillis’ claim, his office pointed to the Morning Consult poll, which was released April 6. The survey of 2,003 registered voters was conducted between April 1 and 4 and had an unweighted margin of error of plus-minus 2 percentage points.Morning Consult, a market research company, reported that 56% of respondents oppose the decision to remove the border controls implemented by the Trump administration. The group has a ""B"" rating with FiveThirtyEight, a website that conducts opinion poll analysis and grades political pollsters. A ""B"" rating means the company is generally reliable but its polling methodology isn’t as good as firms with ""A"" ratings.Polling experts told PolitiFact North Carolina that, due to the way the question was phrased in that poll, they’re not confident the results offer a clear reflection of people’s beliefs about Title 42 specifically. Here’s how Morning Consult phrased its question about Title 42:""As you may know, the Trump administration implemented border controls at the U.S.-Mexico border in March 2020 in order to slow the spread of COVID-19. These controls allowed border officials to quickly expel migrants seeking to enter the U.S. for protection. The Biden administration will remove these border controls on May 23rd. Do you support or oppose the Biden administration removing these border controls?""Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 27, 2023 in a Facebook postU.S. Rep.

Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire’s Survey Center, doubted whether many respondents had much knowledge of the Title 42 policy before they were asked the question. ""But they do know Donald Trump and Joe Biden, and it is no surprise that Biden voters support the change and Trump supporters oppose it as the names are cues to how they should respond,"" he said in an email.Polling experts noticed a pattern between support for Title 42 and support for Biden more generally. Asked whether they approve or disapprove of the job President Joe Biden is doing, 55% of respondents said they disapprove — almost the same number of respondents who said they want to keep Title 42 in place.""Since almost everything now is just a surrogate for ‘us’ or ‘them,’ I’d argue that question is essentially another form of asking about presidential approval,"" Janine Parry, a University of Arkansas political science professor, said in an email.Smith noted that the poll didn’t ask voters questions to determine if they were familiar with the Title 42 policy. ""So there is no way of assessing, in my opinion, what Americans know or don’t know about the original policy, let alone their support for changing it.""PolitiFact NC reached out to Morning Consult seeking comment on the experts’ criticisms, but didn’t receive a response. The group conducted another poll on the issue between April 8-11, after Tillis’ comment. It found that 54% of respondents support Title 42. But, again, the question included references to Biden and Trump.Another pollA poll released on Feb. 22 by the National Immigration Law Center’s Justice Fund omitted the names of politicians when asking about Title 42. The poll, which surveyed 802 likely voters, asked if respondents supported or opposed ending ""the practice of using COVID as a reason to deny asylum seekers entrance to the U.S."" Fifty-two percent said they supported ending the policy.But experts found issues with that poll too. McLennan noticed that the respondents included a higher percentage of women and people with higher education levels than one would expect. Smith said the Justice Fund poll, like the Morning Consult poll, failed to determine whether people were familiar with the policy before asking about it. Questions from both polls ""assume a level of knowledge about the topic that is likely not there, certainly among most people."" Our rulingTillis said ""Most Americans favor keeping Title 42 in place.""One poll of 2,003 registered voters found that 56% of them want to keep Title 42 in place. However, polling experts say the phrasing of the question wasn’t ideal in that it invoked the names of Trump and Biden.

Put another way, out of the 8.5% rate in March, the measure accounted for something between one quarter to one half of inflation.Economist Dean Baker, with the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, puts the number at about two percentage points.""My main basis for saying this is that other wealthy countries, without remotely comparable stimulus packages, have seen comparable jumps in their inflation rates,"" Baker said.Baker looked at Europe to help tease out the global inflation drivers from the American ones. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the conservative-leaning American Action Forum, also compared the U.S. with Europe. Between the first and last quarters of 2021, European inflation went up three points. In the same period, U.S. inflation rose more than four points.Featured Fact-checkRon DeSantisstated on January 17, 2023 in a press conference""Almost every study now has said with these new boosters, you're more likely to get infected with the bivalent booster.""By Yacob Reyes • January 20, 2023!function(e,i,n,s){var t=""InfogramEmbeds"",d=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(""script"");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,""infogram-async"");Several inflationary forces affected nearly every nation.COVID cut into the supply of workers and goods. Businesses struggled to find employees. Manufacturers couldn’t get the parts they needed — the shortage of microchips was a prominent example. Both dynamics pushed prices higher.The resurging economy outstripped the supply of oil and natural gas, leading to higher energy costs. As the pandemic eased, the economic recovery also triggered shortfalls in the supply of grains and other farm products.""Europe had to deal with the supply-side, the broken supply-chains and the rest,"" Holtz-Eakin said. ""They did not do stimulus to the extent we did, and they still got inflation.""Holtz-Eakin pointed to the moment when the U.S. and Europe parted ways — in the second quarter of 2021. That was right after passage of the American Rescue Plan.About half of the U.S. increase of four percentage points ""you can easily attribute to the stimulus,"" Holtz Eakin  said.Other economists estimate higher impacts.Michael Strain with the free-market-oriented American Enterprise Institute put the figure at about three points for 2021. Harvard economist and former Obama administration official Jason Furman said it could be as high as four points in 2022.Sorting out effects of the war and the pre-Biden spendingGoing forward, it’s likely to get harder to tease out the inflationary impact of the American Rescue Plan. Russia’s attack on Ukraine disrupted a world economy that was still sorting itself out after COVID. Sanctions aimed at cutting Russia’s energy revenues sent oil and gas prices soaring. The war’s crippling hit on Ukraine’s agricultural sector, combined with sanctions (Russia is a major wheat producer), has raised the prices of basic goods like wheat and sunflower oil.Baker says that in ordinary times, with the bulk of the stimulus already spent, the economy would be on its way toward balance.""However, the special factors of the pandemic and war prevent that,"" Baker said. ""And of course, oil is a big part of the problem.""Another complicating factor is the effect of the spending that came before Biden took office. Two bipartisan COVID-relief packages cost over $3 trillion. Goldwein said it all contributed to inflation, though he thinks the American Rescue Plan added more, because it came as the economy was already springing back. Holtz-Eakin also said that the earlier spending was more in line with the level of economic damage due to the pandemic.There is concern that companies are profiting from inflation, and fueling it further. Baker said corporate profits are high, but  he’s neither surprised by the trend, nor does he see anything conspiratorial at hand.""The way you ration demand is with higher prices,"" Baker said. ""This might be a good argument for higher corporate taxes, since they have been the big winners, and there clearly are competitiveness problems in many industries, but I don't think that is the story of the current inflation.""Our rulingTimken said Biden's spending ""has sent prices skyrocketing.""The 2021 American Rescue Plan Act added about $1.9 trillion to the economy, and economists across the political spectrum say that it spurred inflation. They differ on the precise scale of its impact, with estimates ranging from two to four additional points out of the current inflation rate of about 8.5%.However, none of the experts we reached, liberal and conservative, said Biden’s actions were responsible for all of the inflation. Past government spending, COVID’s disruptions to labor markets, energy prices and supply-chains also played significant roles.

94,Jill Terreri,“Cities in notoriously ‘tough on crime’ states like Texas and Florida saw a more significant increase in violent crime than cities in NYS.”,"Assembly Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes, D-Buffalo, defended New York state’s bail law amid charges by Republicans and others that changes to it in 2020 are contributing to rising violent crime. ""Cities in notoriously ‘tough on crime’ states like Texas and Florida saw a more significant increase in violent crime than cities in NYS,"" she said in a statement. Changes to the bail law were intended to make the system fairer. Advocates said poor people should not remain in jail awaiting trial simply because they cannot afford to post bail, while those who can afford it are released. We wondered if Peoples-Stokes was correct. Did cities in Texas and Florida, where bail laws did not change, also see bigger increases in violent crime?   Because Peoples-Stokes said ""cities,"" we looked at the four violent crime categories -- murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault -- in the 10 largest cities in each state during 2020. This is the most recent year with the most complete data available, and we looked at data reported by city police departments and published by the public safety division of each state government.In general, murders and aggravated assaults increased, while rapes and robberies did not. But we found no clear pattern in the state data among the cities in each state.MurdersMurders went up 34% in Buffalo and 17% in Yonkers. In New York City, they went up 46.7%, slightly more than the 45% increase in Rochester.There are cities in Florida and Texas where the percentage increase was roughly the same or even higher than the New York cities. In Houston murders increased by 45%. In Fort Worth, they went up 59%. Murders rose 42% in Miami and 76% in Fort Lauderdale. But in San Antonio, the increase was only 20%. And in some cities in all three states, the number of murders fell. In El Paso, for example, the number of murders went down by 30%.When we calculated the overall increase among the cities in each state -- disregarding cities that had just a few murders, where a small increase would lead to a large percentage increase -- the increase in New York state came to 46%, compared with 31% in Texas and 22% in Florida. Featured Fact-checkRon DeSantisstated on January 17, 2023 in a press conference""Almost every study now has said with these new boosters, you're more likely to get infected with the bivalent booster.""By Yacob Reyes • January 20, 2023According to Pew Research Center, which used data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, murders rose by 30% between 2019 and 2020 across the country.

The number of homicides per 100,000 remains lower in New York, at 4.7 at the end of 2020, than in Florida, 7.8, and Texas, 7.6. RobberiesRobberies fell in all 30 cities, except for San Antonio, Austin and Tampa. New York City reported a 1.6% decline in robberies. Nine of the 10 Florida cities posted bigger percent declines. Eight of the Texas cities had bigger percentage declines.Aggravated assaultsOverall, the data showed a percentage increase in aggravated assaults in the 10 cities we looked at in each of the three states. In New York, the overall increase was 4%, less than the 21% increases in Florida and in Texas. RapesThe number of reported rapes fell in most cities in each of the three states. Nine of the 10 Florida cities had fewer reported rapes, as did nine of 10 Texas cities. Rapes fell in seven of the 10 New York state cities. The percentage decline in rapes in New York was 19%. Rapes declined in the Florida cities by 15% and in the Texas cities by 17%. Evidence citedWe approached Peoples-Stokes’ office for evidence of her claim, and her staff sent several sources, including a report from November 2020 regarding violent crime rates through Sept. 30, 2020, from the Police Executive Research Forum, a nonprofit organization whose members are high-ranking police officials. The report found a 66% increase in homicides and a 39% increase in aggravated assaults in Fort Worth while El Paso saw a decrease in homicides of 66%. Tampa  had an increase in aggravated assaults of 35%. There was no mention of New York cities in the report.  To Peoples-Stokes’ point about the effect of bail law changes in New York, other investigations have found that among people who were released under the 2020 bail changes, few committed violent offenses after release. Our ruling Peoples-Stokes said that ""cities in notoriously ‘tough on crime’ states like Texas and Florida saw a more significant increase in violent crime than cities in NYS.""It is true some cities in Texas and Florida that saw greater increases in some categories of violent crime than cities in New York state between 2019 and 2020.

Trump invited the crowd to ""walk down to the Capitol"" where the House and Senate were holding a joint session to certify the electoral college vote for Biden. A mob breached the Capitol and shut down Congress for hours. Early Jan. 7, after the attack was quelled, Congress certified Biden’s win. Lee and Graham voted to certify the presidential election results and against objections to certifying the results in Arizona and Pennsylvania.In supporting the election result, Lee said on the Senate floor:""I’ve met with lawyers on both sides of the issue. I’ve met with lawyers representing the Trump campaign, reading everything I could find about the constitutional provisions in question, and I’ve spent a lot of time on the phone with legislators and other leaders from the contested states….""I spent an enormous amount of time reaching out to state government officials in those states, but in none of the contested states — no, not even one — did I discover any indication that there was any chance that any state legislature, or secretary of state, or governor, or lieutenant governor, had any intention to alter the slate of electors.""Details of Lee’s actions have been publicly reported.""Peril,"" a September 2021 book by Washington Post associate editor Bob Woodward and reporter Robert Costa described how Graham and Lee took the claims of election fraud seriously enough to get briefed on the details, involve their senior staff and call state officials throughout the country. As summarized by the Post, a key document was a memo written about counting electoral votes by conservative legal scholar John Eastman, who is referenced in the ad.Lee received an Eastman memo from the White House that said Vice President Mike Pence could ignore seven states that had submitted dueling slates of electors to Congress, split between Trump and Biden, and count only electors from the remaining states, handing the election to Trump. Woodward and Costa reported that Lee knew the alternate electors were merely Trump loyalists putting themselves forward in certain states, in a move the authors describe as ""a social media campaign — an amateur push with no legal standing.""Featured Fact-checkMauro Garzastated on January 24, 2022 in an ad“They call” Jan. 6 “an insurrection,” but “were FBI agents used as political agitators?""By Tom Kertscher • February 7, 2022Lee said that he made ""phone call after phone call"" to officials in some of the relevant states, such as Georgia, Pennsylvania and Arizona, saying that no one seemed poised to certify a new slate of electors.

He said that Trump’s inner circle repeatedly told him that state legislatures were acting to decertify or even recertify their slates of electoral votes before Congress convened on Jan. 6. As that date approached, Lee said, ""I became concerned because I wasn’t seeing any of these developments occur but I was continuing to hear this narrative."" Lee said that after calling governors, attorneys general, secretaries of state and legislative leaders in several states, not one state was willing or inclined to decertify or recertify their electoral votes.UTpolunderground.com, a political news website, also carried an article about Lee’s outreach to state officials and his conclusion that there was no evidence to overturn the election.

97,D.L. Davis,"""The price of insulin has been jacked up by Big Drug Corporations.”","When it comes to diabetes, the numbers are stark.One in 10 Americans have the disease, and more than one in three have pre-diabetes, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. What’s more, people are developing diabetes at younger ages and a faster rate.A recent tweet from U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who has cosponsored legislation to cap the out-of-pocket cost of insulin for Americans at $35 per month, made a stark claim of its own:""The price of insulin has been jacked up by Big Drug Corporations,"" Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, said in the March 16, 2022, tweet. ""35 million Americans who have diabetes need lower costs. We can cap the price of insulin at $35 with our Affordable Insulin Now Act. Let's have a Senate vote and pass it!""The House of Representatives voted a few weeks later, on March 31, 2022, to approve the Affordable Insulin Now Act, which would cap insulin prices at either $35 a month or 25% of an insurance plan's negotiated price — whichever is lower.  But the fate of the measure in the Senate remains unclear. So what can one make of Baldwin’s tweet? Are costs of insulin in the United States excessive? And what can be said about whether high prices are due to being ""jacked up by Big Drug Corporations""? A common conditionDiabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Most people’s bodies naturally produce insulin, a hormone that helps convert sugars from food into energy the body can use or store for later. ""When you have diabetes, your body either doesn’t make insulin or doesn’t use its insulin well, causing your blood sugar to rise,"" according to the CDC. ""High blood sugar levels can cause serious health problems over time.""When a person has Type 1 diabetes, the body can’t make insulin, and he or she will need to take insulin every day. With Type 2 diabetes, your body doesn’t use insulin well. ""Losing weight, eating well and exercising can help you manage the disease,"" according to the Mayo Clinic. ""If diet and exercise aren't enough to manage your blood sugar, you may also need diabetes medications or insulin therapy.""About 30 million Americans have diabetes, and about 31% take insulin to manage the condition, according to the Commonwealth Fund, a private U.S. foundation whose stated purpose is to ""promote a high-performing health care system that achieves better access, improved quality, and greater efficiency…""According to the American Diabetes Association, those with diabetes account for $1 of every $4 spent on healthcare in the United States.Uncommonly high costsLet’s start with some statistics that underline how high costs are in the U.S. According to an April 2020 report from the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C., the average list price of insulin increased 11% annually from 2001 to 2018, with average annual per capita insulin costs now nearing $6,000. According to an October 2021 report from the Health Care Cost Institute, an independent nonprofit that studies health care prices, in its data sample the average monthly out-of-pocket spending on insulin in 2019 was $82. And ""among the 8.7% of individuals in the highest spending category, the median monthly out-of-pocket spending on insulin was $315.""The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says Americans pay 10 times what people in other developed countries pay.Featured Fact-checkRon DeSantisstated on January 17, 2023 in a press conference""Almost every study now has said with these new boosters, you're more likely to get infected with the bivalent booster.""By Yacob Reyes • January 20, 2023Meanwhile, a January 2021 Forbes article reported that net costs of insulin to pharmacy benefit managers and payers have decreased in recent years because of steep rebates, but the savings very often have not been passed through to patients. The bottom line: Americans pay a high cost for insulin – far higher than in other countries.But in her claim, Baldwin pinned the blame on the drug companies, when there are many factors involved in pricing and many points where prices – and profits – can be increased. When we asked Baldwin’s office for backup for the claim, it pointed us to several reports and articles on insulin costs and affordability and a 2021 Senate committee report on what is behind it.The bipartisan staff report from the Senate Finance Committee noted that ""(insulin) manufacturers are retaining more revenue from insulin than in the 2000s,"" and that ""the amount of revenue pharmaceutical manufacturers are retaining from insulin has risen.""""Insulin manufacturers compete fiercely, using rebates as bargaining chips to receive preferred formulary placement for their products and to block competition,"" the Senate report reads.  ""The companies undertake these bidding wars to maximize revenue and capture — or maintain — market share. Furthermore, in some cases the investigation found that while insulin manufacturers closely monitor their competitors’ pricing actions when determining their own list prices over time, there were multiple instances of companies increasing prices in lockstep with competitors.""So, that supports Baldwin’s claim. But others note that’s not the full picture.Dr. Jing Luo, assistant professor of Medicine at the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh, said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, ""There was a time when list prices for insulin rose at a rapid clip…on the order of 30% per year. Those price increases came from the manufacturers themselves.""Luo, whose research focuses on prescription drug use, pricing and policy, especially for medicines treating chronic diseases such as diabetes, also noted: ""In recent years we have noticed that the list price changes are not as dramatic as they had been previously. This is probably due to much higher public scrutiny.""Luo, in a Dec. 10, 2021 WBUR radio article said the limited number of TextEditormanufacturers in the U.S. are part of the equation.""When you have a setting where there (are) only a few suppliers, but the demand for the medication is quite great,"" he told WBUR, ""it results in a situation where manufacturers can raise their prices without much blowback.""As to Baldwin’s claim, he said it is ""a simplification of the complex system we have that allows drug manufacturers to set whatever price they desire.""Karen Van Nuys, executive director of Value of Life Sciences Innovation at the University of Southern California, said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin that big drug corporations often get the blame for rising insulin prices, but their research shows ""they are actually not the culprits in this case.""""The amount manufacturers have been receiving per 100mL of insulin has actually been declining steadily over the last several years,"" Van Nuys said. ""What has been increasing is the amount of money drug distribution intermediaries — pharmacies, pharmacy benefit managers, health plans and wholesalers — have been pocketing.""Insulin is measured in International Units (units); most insulin is U-100, which means that 100 units of insulin are equal to 1 mL.Our rulingBaldwin said ""the price of insulin has been jacked up by Big Drug Corporations.""There is no question that U.S. consumers pay more than those in other countries. And there is strong evidence that drug company profits are a key factor in the higher costs. But experts note that there are other factors involved – and other steps along the way where profits are taken. And those entities also play a role in the higher costs.For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.  window.gciAnalyticsUAID = 'PMJS-TEALIUM-COBRAND';window.gciAnalyticsLoadEvents = false;window.gciAnalytics.view({    'event-type': 'pageview',    'content-type': 'interactives',    'content-ssts-section': 'news',    'content-ssts-subsection': 'news:politics',    'content-ssts-topic': 'news:politics:politifactwisconsin',    'content-ssts-subtopic': ' news:politics:politifactwisconsin'});",Tammy Baldwin,"April 8, 2022",half-true

The mandate required health care workers to be vaccinated by Sept. 27, 2021. On Oct. 5. Hochul — who had been elevated to governor following Cuomo’s resignation — extended the mandate to apply to workers in mental health and disability services. Under the new mandate, health care workers in these facilities had until Nov. 1 to get at least one vaccination. Featured Fact-checkRon DeSantisstated on January 17, 2023 in a press conference""Almost every study now has said with these new boosters, you're more likely to get infected with the bivalent booster.""By Yacob Reyes • January 20, 2023The Astorino campaign said its tweet was based on New York State Health Department data showing that 33,982 health care workers were inactive because of the vaccine mandate. ""We believe Rob's claims are completely accurate,"" Phil Oliva, a spokesperson for the Astorio campaign, told us in an email.However, the Astorino campaign’s reading of the numbers was faulty.The New York State Health Department told PolitiFact New York that ""approximately 3% of health workers were furloughed, terminated, or opted to resign or retire."" Data released by Hochul’s office on Oct. 13 showed that the number of health care workers who had left their jobs was 33,982, but that the number who had specifically been fired was 10,555. That’s less than one-third of the total loss in health care workers.In public comments on Oct. 13, 2021, Hochul reiterated that the number of lost jobs were greater than just those who were fired. ""It includes people who were terminated, resignations, people deciding to retire, and people who are on furlough waiting to see the outcome of litigation"" against the mandate.In addition, it was up to employers, rather than the governor, to determine what happened to employees who did not comply, said Erin Silk, a spokesperson for the New York State Health Department. ""Those plans could include termination, but that was not required,"" Silk said.Our rulingAstorino said Hochul’s record included ""firing"" 34,000 health care workers.About 34,000 health care workers in New York state did leave their job after the vaccine mandate was enacted.

99,Jon Greenberg,"In cutting greenhouse gas emissions, the United States is “the leader in the world by far.”","The latest United Nations climate change report had a grim forecast: If greenhouse gas emissions don’t peak within three years, then there’s little hope of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.Alaska Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan says one of the best moves the United States could make is to speed up the shift in places like China and India from coal to natural gas.Sullivan has a plan to increase American natural gas production, liquify it and ship it overseas. His key supporting argument is the hefty 14% drop in American carbon dioxide emissions over the last 15 years.""If every other country in the world had a record like this, where do you think we would be on global emissions?"" Sullivan said at a March 23 Senate hearing. ""We are the leader in the world by far.""Whether the U.S. is the world leader in cutting emissions depends on how you measure things. In total metric tons, Sullivan is right. But in relative terms, many economic peers achieved steeper declines. Sullivan’s chart requires a closer lookAt the Senate hearing, Sullivan displayed a chart showing the change in carbon dioxide emissions in nine countries between 2005 and 2020. The U.S. stands out with a fall between those years of 970 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. Japan’s emissions went down 237 million metric tons. China, on the other hand, released an additional 4,689 million metric tons in 2020 than it did in 2005, while India’s emissions rose 1,315 million metric tons.Chart used by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, to show carbon dioxide emission trends for nine countries. (Office of Dan Sullivan)Sullivan’s staff pulled these numbers from the website Our World in Data, a reliable resource based at the University of Oxford in England. The numbers are accurate, although climate trackers warn against including 2020 numbers, because the COVID-19 economic shutdown distorted normal emission patterns. In our analysis, we looked at 2005 to 2019.The first caveat to Sullivan’s approach is that he uses absolute numbers. Rob Jackson, an earth systems professor at Stanford University, said the chart is ""conveniently misleading."" The United States has the largest reduction because, in 2005, Jackson said, it had the highest emissions.""Other countries, in Europe in particular, have done far more than we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,"" Jackson said.Looking at the percentage change in carbon dioxide emissions, the United Kingdom made the greatest progress, with a reduction of 35%. Italy, France and Germany came next. The United States and Japan tied for fifth place with reductions of about 14%.!function(e,i,n,s){var t=""InfogramEmbeds"",d=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(""script"");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,""infogram-async""); Sullivan spokesman Ben Dietderich agreed that the relative changes reshuffled the rankings, but he countered that the absolute number of tons mattered most. It’s the tons of carbon dioxide that affect the global climate, he said. At the end of the day, Dietderich said, the United States made the largest contribution to reducing carbon dioxide emissions.Jackson raised another issue with Sullivan’s chart — it left out emissions per person. China’s emissions are enormous, but the country also has 1.4 billion people. Viewed through that lens, despite the decline in U.S. emissions, the United States remained the larger emitter per capita.Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on January 17, 2023 in an Instagram postGreta Thunberg staged an arrest in Germany.By Ciara O'Rourke • January 19, 2023""Our per capita emissions are still twice China’s and eight times higher than India’s,"" Jackson said.!function(e,i,n,s){var t=""InfogramEmbeds"",d=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(""script"");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,""infogram-async""); Sullivan’s focus on carbon dioxide doesn’t give the full picture of American emissions. There are other greenhouse gases, most importantly methane and nitrous oxide. The same website that provided the carbon dioxide numbers also has data for greenhouse gases across the board.Factoring in all greenhouse gases, the U.S. trends are less dramatic. The total decline goes from a reduction of 879 million metric tons to 607 million metric tons. As a percentage, the decline goes from 14.3% for carbon dioxide alone to 9.5% for all greenhouse gases combined. The numbers work that way because it doesn’t take much of those other gases to put a lot of carbon into the air.While natural gas was the single largest factor in cutting U.S. emissions, major contributions also came from the rise in wind power and efficiency gains in American industry that lowered demand.The limits of expanding natural gas productionSullivan’s point was that if other countries followed the United States’ lead, global emissions would fall. Since the blossoming of natural gas production played a large role in the U.S., it makes sense, he said, to expand production further and export to coal-burning countries like China and India.Not so fast, say energy researchers.Michael Young, a senior scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, said building the pipelines and processing plants to send natural gas overseas adds carbon to the atmosphere. It’s possible, Young said, that exports to Asia could reduce emissions there if they replaced coal or wood.""But it’s also true that liquified natural gas from the U.S. will embed carbon dioxide emissions in the production and transportation of the fuel, reducing the benefits,"" Young said. ""Whether the two balance out depends on many factors.""Ben King, a senior analyst at Rhodium Group, a private research center, said while industry is getting better at preventing the release of methane gas, it still happens in the liquefaction process.More troubling, King said, is that building new plants to export natural gas is a 30-year investment.""Locking in long-lived fossil fuel assets runs directly counter to the need, recently affirmed in the latest International Panel on Climate Change report, to quickly transition away from uncontrolled fossil fuel use,"" King said.Our rulingSullivan said the United States is ""the leader in the world by far"" in cutting greenhouse gas emissions. In absolute terms, that is accurate – but it isn’t telling the full story. Relative to the scale of emissions in other leading economies, other countries show much deeper reductions. Sullivan also left out emissions per person in the United States. While those have gone down, they are still about twice as high as they are in China. We rate this claim Half True.",Dan Sullivan,"April 6, 2022",half-true
100,D.L. Davis,"Says Gov. Tony Evers ""tried to make us pay even more at the pump by hiking the gas tax.""","Drivers are taking a hit to the wallet as world events, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, are causing crude oil prices to increase, sending gasoline prices to record-breaking levels.During the week of March 7, 2022, the average national gas price hit $4.104 per gallon according to GasBuddy.com. The previous all-time high was set in 2008 at $4.103 per gallon. Since then, prices have nudged downward, with GasBuddy reporting $3.69 to $3.79 per gallon in Milwaukee, Franklin, Wauwatosa and Waukesha and $3.85 in Lannon on April 1.In the midst of that, an affiliate of Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce (WMC) – the WMC Issues Mobilization Council – released a TV ad that slammed Gov. Tony Evers’ economic record. Among the claims in the ad: Evers ""tried to make us pay even more at the pump by hiking the gas tax.""Is the group right?Plan ties gas tax to rate of inflation When asked for backup or the claim, Nick Novak, WMC’s vice president of communications and marketing, pointed to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau’s summary of Evers’ proposed 2019-21 budget. On page 406, under the heading ""Motor Vehicle Fuel Tax Rate Increase,"" is the following: ""Increase the motor vehicle fuel tax rate (gasoline, gasoline blended with ethanol, and diesel) by eight cents per gallon resulting in a rate of 38.9 cents per gallon, effective October 1, 2019. The current motor vehicle fuel tax rate has been in effect since April 1, 2006, when the final annual indexing adjustment increased the rate to the current 30.9 cents per gallon rate."" In other words, the gas tax would be increased and – in the future – be tied and rise automatically with the rate of inflation. That’s what’s meant by indexing.For instance, the fiscal bureau estimated the gas tax under the plan would rise to 39.7 cents in April 2020 and 40.5 cents in April 2021. These increases would have cost Wisconsinites $41.6 million over the 2019-21 budget period. (A more recent memo from the bureau, dated March 31, 2022, estimated that the indexing would have brought the total to 42.0 cents per gallon on April 1, 2022. )So, Evers definitely pushed a gas tax increase.But that’s only part of the picture.When the increase was proposed – with the money it generated to go toward increased transportation funding – Evers also proposed eliminating the state’s longstanding minimum markup law for gasoline.The minimum markup law was created during the Great Depression to protect small business from larger rivals. The law mandates a price floor where goods like gas, groceries, and beer are ""marked up"" so they are not used as ""loss leaders"" at a price level where the other businesses can’t compete. Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 19, 2023 in a videoThe Transportation Security Administration spent “a couple hundred million dollars” on gender-neutral screening technology.By Gabrielle Settles • January 27, 2023The state Department of Administration – overseen by Evers – said repealing the minimum markup law (which it labeled a ""hidden tax"") would save up to 14-cents per gallon. In other words, the Evers plan would have resulted in a net reduction for drivers at the pump of 6 cents per gallon.(From that perspective, even with rises tied to indexing in the subsequent years, based on the new fiscal bureau memo there would still be a per-gallon savings – though, of course, this is taking a narrow look at the gas tax, not overall economic matters that would affect price.)At  the time, the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, a conservative law firm, in an analysis of the Evers proposal noted elimination of the minimum markup law ""could immediately put more money back into the pockets of hard-working Wisconsinites all over the state"" but argued it ""should be fully repealed – not just for gasoline – and it should not be contingent on a tax increase."" The idea from Evers was not entirely new.Republican lawmakers floated a similar plan in 2017 that would have raised the gas tax while curbing the minimum markup law, but the idea flopped when then-Gov. Scott Walker said he would not back it. This time, the GOP-held Legislature ultimately rejected Evers’ proposal and instead raised the title fee paid when vehicles are purchased by 137%, from $69.50 to $164.50. They also raised annual vehicle registration fees by $10, from $75 to $85.In any case, all of that goes against the idea that the primary aim of Evers’ plan was to simply raise the gas taxKayla Anderson, an Evers campaign spokeswoman, said the governor ""was intentionally trying to ensure consumers would pay less at the pump, not more, by repealing the state's minimum markup law. Studies from both sides of the aisle have shown that the minimum markup law results in higher prices for consumers.""That’s fair, to a point. But Novak, the WMC spokesman, noted ""even the Legislative Fiscal Bureau explained at the time that there may not be a change in the retail price of fuel by repealing the minimum markup law.""Indeed, a March 2019 summary of the governor’s 2019-21 budget from the fiscal bureau said: ""Changes in retail fuel prices as a result of the provision, if any, would be subject to a variety of market and competitive factors, which are assumed to exert considerable influence on final retail prices independent of the statutory markup.""Our rulingA WMC Issues Mobilization Council ad claimed Evers ""tried to make us pay even more at the pump by hiking the gas tax.""In his first budget, the governor did propose an increase in the gas tax. But the ad ignores what was coupled with it: A move to eliminate the state’s ""minimum markup"" law as it relates to gasoline, which Evers and his office argued would be a net reduction for drivers. The inclusion of the elimination of the minimum markup law for gasoline in the plan undermines the idea that Evers was trying to make consumers pay more. At the same time, it was – and remains – far from clear that the elimination would reduce prices in the long run. And we have already seen, with inflation, that much of that initial savings would already have been eaten up.For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.  window.gciAnalyticsUAID = 'PMJS-TEALIUM-COBRAND';window.gciAnalyticsLoadEvents = false;window.gciAnalytics.view({    'event-type': 'pageview',    'content-type': 'interactives',    'content-ssts-section': 'news',    'content-ssts-subsection': 'news:politics',    'content-ssts-topic': 'news:politics:politifactwisconsin',    'content-ssts-subtopic': ' news:politics:politifactwisconsin'});",Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce,"April 1, 2022",half-true
101,Eleanor Hildebrandt,"“Gas prices have been going up since the president’s first day in office, starting with his move to shut down the Keystone XL pipeline.”","Americans have shared plenty of complaints about gas price increases and U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst is among them. Ernst, R-Iowa, opened a March 19 newsletter email blast claiming gas prices have continued to rise since President Joe Biden’s first day in office back in January 2021:""President Biden wants Iowans and Americans to believe that skyrocketing prices at the pump are all Vladimir Putin’s fault — but gas prices have been going up since the president’s first day in office, starting with his move to shut down the Keystone XL pipeline.""U.S. gas prices have risen under Biden, data shows, but Ernst’s claim suggests that Biden’s policies and his action on Keystone were a driving factor. Yet, gas prices already were on the rise before he took office, due, energy analysts say, to a change in demand following the easing of pandemic restrictions. Meanwhile,  the sharpest increases at the pump have come since the start of war in Ukraine. PolitiFact reported in December that there is no evidence that Biden’s canceling of the Keystone XL oil pipeline caused an increase in U.S. gas prices. The Pew Research Center found in spring 2020 that the COVID-19 pandemic dropped the average retail gas price by 27% from late February to late April. Gasoline demand was down considerably during many stages of the pandemic. As people returned to more normal daily activities demand — and prices —went up.In an email to PolitiFact Iowa, Ernst spokesperson Brendan Conley wrote that regular gas was priced at $2.36 per gallon during Biden’s first day in office. During the fourth week of March 2022, the prices were $4.24, Conley wrote. Conley wrote that Ernst used U.S. Energy Information Administration data to back her claim. ""As the senator was pointing out in the newsletter, the increase in gas prices was happening well before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,"" he wrote.That’s accurate as far as it goes, but it ignores that the data from the Energy Information Administration shows an increasing trend since April 2020, when gas prices dipped to a low of $1.77 per gallon. That was nine months before Biden took office.West Texas Intermediate grade crude oil reflects a similar trend, with prices increasing from $16.94 per barrel on April 19, 2020, to $110.94 on March 20, 2022. These costs are paid before the oil is refined into gasoline. Featured Fact-checkMorgan Luttrellstated on January 10, 2023 in a tweet""Biden drained America's Strategic Petroleum Reserves to the lowest level since 1984.""By Nusaiba Mizan • January 19, 2023While the cost has dipped slightly at certain times — including in November 2020 and August and November 2021 — the overall trends have been up.

The state had the seventh lowest average gasoline cost then, the association said.On July 14, 2008, gas reached its most recent peak prior to 2022 at $4.11, Energy Information Administration data show. PolitiFact previously reported a broad expert consensus that gas prices are not high as a result of  of any U.S. shutdown of oil production under the Biden administration. Oil production is on par with production levels during former President Donald Trump’s term. PolitiFact also has reported that claiming the most recent, and most severe,spike in gas prices is largely due to Putin and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Our rulingErnst said that ""gas prices have been going up since the president’s first day in office, starting with his move to shut down the Keystone XL pipeline.""She has a point that gas prices, as well as crude oil prices, have been on an upward trajectory for essentially all of Biden’s tenure.However, she ignores that prices started to rise when Trump was president, which experts say stemmed from increased demand for fuel after COVID restrictions eased.

105,Madison Czopek,Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson called former President George W. Bush and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld as “war criminals in a legal filing.”,"From 2005 to 2007, Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson worked as a federal public defender, often representing clients who couldn’t afford lawyers of their own — including Guantanamo Bay detainees. Republican senators have called Jackson’s experience as a federal public defender into question during her confirmation hearings. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, repeatedly claimed that, while defending clients accused of terrorism, Jackson called former President George W. Bush and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld ""war criminals.""""I don’t know you well, but I’ve been impressed by our interaction, and you’ve been gracious and charming,"" Cornyn said on March 22. ""Why in the world would you call Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and George W. Bush war criminals in a legal filing? It seems so out of character for you.""Jackson asked if he was referring to habeas petitions she’d filed, and Cornyn said he was talking about when she’d represented a man the Defense Department had identified as an ""intelligence officer for the Taliban.""""You referred to the secretary of defense and the sitting president of the United States as ‘war criminals,’"" he said.""I was representing my clients and making arguments,"" Jackson replied. ""I’d have to take a look at what you meant. I did not intend to disparage the president or the secretary of defense.""On March 23, Cornyn again made this claim, saying Jackson ""accused (Bush and Rumsfeld) of war crimes. Now, I don’t understand the difference between calling somebody a ‘war criminal’ and accusing them of war crimes.""Cornyn based his claim on habeas petitions from 2005, which Jackson co-filed on behalf of people detained at Guantanamo Bay, the New York Times reported. A habeas petition refers to civil action against an agent that holds a defendant in custody.The petitions named as respondents Bush and Rumsfeld, in their official capacities, and two Guantanamo Bay officials. The Times said they were ""essentially boilerplate habeas corpus petitions"" that allege the U.S. government had tortured the detainees.The petition filed on behalf of Khiali-Gul, for example, reads: ""By the actions described above, Respondents’ acts directing, ordering, confirming, ratifying, and/or conspiring to bring about the torture and other inhumane treatment of Petitioner Khiali-Gul constitute war crimes and/or crimes against humanity"" in violation of the Geneva Conventions.The petition alleged that ""severe physical and psychological abuse and agony"" were intentionally inflicted on Khiali-Gul in an effort to coerce him into providing information or confessions. It said that he had been severely beaten, interrogated while chained in painful positions, exposed to extreme temperatures, held in isolation for prolonged periods of time and deprived of adequate medical care, among other things. Drew Brandewie, a spokesperson for Cornyn, said, ""If someone is being accused of war crimes, then they are implicitly being accused of being a war criminal."" He also emphasized the number of petitions: ""This wasn’t a one-off, random instance. It was deliberate, multiple times.""But legal experts told PolitiFact that simply filing a brief that alleges a respondent’s actions ""constitute war crimes"" is not tantamount to calling a person a war criminal.Victor Romero, a professor at Penn State Law, said it wasn’t fair to claim that arguments made on behalf of a client are equivalent to a lawyer making a direct accusation. ""To do so would fundamentally misunderstand the lawyer’s professional role to be a zealous advocate by mistaking such arguments as the equivalent of that person’s private opinion,"" he said.This is especially true in the case of a habeas petition. Bush and Rumsfeld were named ""because they had ultimate control over Judge Jackson’s client’s liberty,"" said Jonathan Hafetz, a professor at Seton Hall Law School. The petition’s purpose was to ""determine the legality of her client’s detention.""Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 18, 2023 in a Facebook postDocument shows that Hunter Biden paid Joe Biden $50,000 a month in rent.By Samantha Putterman • January 19, 2023The petitions were ""essentially a template"" and identical language was used by other lawyers in different detainee petitions, according to a New York Times report.""It is important for a defense attorney to zealously raise all possible defenses,"" said Leila Sadat, a law professor at Washington University and senior research scholar at Yale Law School.Asked to address Cornyn’s claims, Jackson said public defenders don’t choose their clients but must ""provide vigorous advocacy."" With regards to the petitions filed, she said: ""We were assigned as public defenders, we had very little information because of the confidentiality or classified nature of a lot of the record and as an appellate lawyer it was my obligation to file habeas petitions on behalf of my clients.""Stephen Vladeck, the Charles Alan Wright Chair in Federal Courts at the University of Texas School of Law, said in a series of tweets that the implication that Jackson specifically called Bush and Rumsfeld war criminals was, ""at the very least, misleading."" The filings had to name Bush and Rumsfeld for procedural reasons, Vladeck said, and the respondents named in the petitions ""automatically changed"" when President Barack Obama was inaugurated in 2009.And when President Obama came to office on January 20, 2009, the captions automatically changed, so that they became [Detainee] v. Obama instead of [Detainee] v. Bush — reinforcing the point that naming these defendants officially is not a claim about their personal conduct.— Steve Vladeck (@steve_vladeck) March 22, 2022 Brandewie, Cornyn’s spokesperson, said that even if Jackson was ""required"" to name Bush and Rumsfeld, that ""doesn’t negate her accusation or somehow make it not count. It’s context, maybe, but it doesn’t devalue the meaning of what she wrote in the petition."" Penn State’s Romero countered that alleging a law has been violated is ""not the same as a court declaring after a trial that one is a ‘war criminal.’""""No reasonable person would mistake an attorney’s claim made in the service of their client with their personal opinion about the criminality of an individual,"" he said. Our rulingCornyn claimed Jackson referred to former President George W. Bush and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld as ""war criminals in a legal filing."" Jackson co-filed habeas petitions that alleged Bush and Rumsfeld had mistreated and tortured Guantanamo Bay detainees in ways that ""constitute war crimes."" But the filings did not call either man a ""war criminal."" Experts said that, as a defense lawyer, Jackson was obligated to raise all possible defenses on behalf of her clients. In addition, they said it is unfair to claim that arguments a lawyer has made on behalf of a client are equivalent to that lawyer making direct accusations of criminality. Cornyn’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and context.

107,Madeline Heim,“Gov. Tony Evers brought Republicans and Democrats together to cut income taxes for the middle class.”,"Wisconsin Republicans and Democrats both want credit for a massive tax cut signed into state law last summer. In a sign of the times, the two parties can’t agree on whether the move — part of the Republican-written state budget that Democratic Gov. Tony Evers signed into law — was a bipartisan one or not. Republican leadership said no. Evers said yes.The Wisconsin Initiative, a group whose website says it works to enact progressive policies, hold elected officials accountable and find solutions to issues facing the state’s working families, says yes, too.  A pro-Evers television ad from the group says the move would help working families with rising costs and declared that Evers ""brought Republicans and Democrats together to cut income taxes for the middle class."" But that doesn’t exactly describe what happened. Let’s take a look. How the tax cut plan unfoldedWhen Evers released his two-year spending plan for the state Feb. 16, 2021, it included a net increase of $1 billion in taxes over the biennium. He aimed to give tax breaks to the lower and middle classes and raise taxes on businesses and the wealthy. Republicans didn’t care for it. They removed his tax increases and breaks and, after learning the state would receive more than $4 billion extra in tax collections over the next three years, proposed a plan to cut more than $2 billion in taxes in their own budget. That included lowering one tax bracket from 6.27% to 5.3%, covering incomes up to $263,000 for individuals and up to $351,000 for married couples. The nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimated at the time that about three-quarters of the cuts would go to those making $100,000 or more a year. When Evers signed that budget, he cheered the tax cut and said it delivered on his promise to cut taxes for middle-class families. Republicans didn’t like that, either. ""Governor Tony Evers deserves NO credit for signing our budget,"" Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, R-Oostburg, said in a statement at the time, arguing it was not a bipartisan victory but rather that Evers was ""boxed into a corner.""Featured Fact-checkAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezstated on January 27, 2023 in an interview with reporters“The largest contributor to the debt ceiling, or to our deficit, has been the Trump tax cuts.”By Louis Jacobson • February 1, 2023Evers said his signature on the Republican-written budget by nature made it a bipartisan effort.""I signed the budget — simple as that. I could have vetoed that,"" he said at the time. Evers signed the budget, but the tax cut plan was written by RepublicansWhen reached by PolitiFact Wisconsin, Morgan Grunow, executive director of the Wisconsin Initiative, pointed to bipartisan support as the Republicans’ budget moved through the Legislature as well as Evers’ final signature. When it passed the state Assembly on June 29, 2021, four Democrats joined Republicans in supporting it. Three Democrats in the state Senate voted for the plan the next day before sending it to Evers’ desk. ""At the end of the day, Governor Evers introduced the budget, Democrats and Republicans both voted for it, and Evers signed into law,"" Grunow wrote in an email. ""Bipartisan agreement on anything, especially this day and age, seems to align with the idea of bringing people together. The final vote tally speaks for itself.""It’s correct that Evers has long pushed for middle-class tax cuts. He campaigned on cutting state income taxes by 10% for Wisconsinites making $100,000 a year or less. (PolitiFact Wisconsin rated that campaign promise as a Compromise last July because he’d pledged to do so in his first budget, not his second.)But it was the Republican-written budget, not his own, that eventually accomplished that goal for him. And while the budget that was ultimately signed into law received bipartisan support in both legislative chambers, Evers didn’t personally spur those Democratic lawmakers to join with their Republican colleagues. His actions didn’t necessarily bring people together — the pieces unfolded on their own. Our rulingThe Wisconsin Initiative claimed Evers ""brought Republicans and Democrats together to cut income taxes for the middle class.""The end result of the maneuvering was that both sides — Evers and Legislative Republicans — signed off on tax cuts. But it was more the result of political maneuvering and budgetary good fortune than bipartisan outreach on the part of Evers.Our definition of Half True is a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That fits here. window.gciAnalyticsUAID = 'PMJS-TEALIUM-COBRAND';window.gciAnalyticsLoadEvents = false;window.gciAnalytics.view({    'event-type': 'pageview',    'content-type': 'interactives',    'content-ssts-section': 'news',    'content-ssts-subsection': 'news:politics',    'content-ssts-topic': 'news:politics:politifactwisconsin',    'content-ssts-subtopic': ' news:politics:politifactwisconsin'});",Wisconsin Initiative,"March 22, 2022",half-true

109,Tyler Smith,"“The Manhattan DA is actually proposing to downgrade armed robbery to a misdemeanor, and to stop prosecuting resisting arrest.”","Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg attracted attention, including criticism, for implementing new prosecutorial policies shortly after taking office Jan. 1. Critics perceived a memo by Bragg as laying out policies that would treat some cases too lightly, such as those involving resisting arrest and armed robbery. A Democrat running for governor of New York, Rep. Tom Suozzi, was one of those taking a shot at Bragg, a fellow Democrat. Suozzi posted a campaign advertisement to his Twitter account on Jan. 21 that featured a tough-on-crime message.""The Manhattan DA is actually proposing to downgrade armed robbery to a misdemeanor, and to stop prosecuting resisting arrest,"" Suozzi’s ad said.📺 I released my first TV ad of the campaign on the crime crisis in NY.If any DA refuses to enforce the law, I’ll remove them. @KathyHochul refuses to act. I will. pic.twitter.com/dBX3GwRKDa— Tom Suozzi (@Tom_Suozzi) January 21, 2022 However, the reality is more complicated than that. In addition, shortly after Suozzi’s ad stopped running, Bragg released a new memo clarifying his policies.Bragg’s original memoIn a Jan. 3 memo, Bragg said his office would increase its emphasis on both ""diversion"" and ""declination.""It defined diversion as ""the opportunity to complete a short but meaningful programming mandate after arrest through a community-based provider, based on the needs of the person arrested."" It defined declination as a decision not to prosecute a case after an arrest was made. Bragg argued that investing in alternatives to incarceration would reduce recidivism and allow his office’s resources to be dedicated to the most serious, and often violent, crimes. Reducing the prosecution of nonviolent offenses would disproportionately benefit people of color.In the memo, Bragg said a robbery that might otherwise qualify as a felony should be prosecuted as a misdemeanor ""if the force or threat of force consists of displaying a dangerous instrument or similar behavior but does not create a genuine risk of physical harm."" The memo also said that resisting arrest would not be prosecuted by his office unless accompanied by another charge not included on the list of offenses the office was generally declining to prosecute. The list of cases the office wouldn’t be prosecuting included marijuana misdemeanors, including selling more than three ounces; not paying a public transportation fare; trespassing, except a fourth-degree stalking charge; certain cases of obstructing governmental administration; and prostitution.Suozzi’s advertisement summarized these changes without adding important nuance.Under Bragg’s memo, not all armed robberies would be downgraded to misdemeanors, just those determined not to ""create a genuine risk of physical harm.""Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 26, 2023 in a postThe officers who beat Tyre Nichols targeted him because he was “allegedly dating” one of their wives.By Madison Czopek • February 1, 2023And under the memo, resisting arrest would continue to be prosecuted if it accompanied another prosecuted crime.Criticism and clarificationThe Jan. 3 memo drew criticism from residents, police, and some politicians; they argued that Bragg’s insistence on downplaying the role of incarceration made streets less safe and left police vulnerable. Criticism intensified after news reports of a case that Bragg’s office prosecuted as a misdemeanor. The suspect was alleged to have stolen about $2,000 worth of cold medicine from a drug store while wielding a pocket knife and threatening a manager. It was the man’s 39th arrest.Critics said that if the case had been heard two weeks earlier – under the previous prosecutorial policies – it would have been tried as robbery in the first degree, a felony.Later, when a gunman fatally shot two New York City policemen on Jan. 21, the wife of one of the officers used the funeral as a platform to criticize Bragg. Under increasing pressure over his office policies, Bragg on Feb. 4 issued an updated memo, acknowledging that his Jan. 3 memo had become ""a source of confusion, rather than clarity.""The new memo addressed both the prosecution of armed robberies and of resisting arrest.""A commercial robbery with a gun will be charged as a felony, whether or not the gun is operable, loaded, or a realistic imitation,"" the new memo said. ""A commercial robbery at knifepoint, or by other weapon that creates a risk of physical harm, will be charged as a felony. In retail thefts that do not involve a risk of physical harm, the office will continue to assess the charges based on all of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances presented.""As for resisting arrest, the memo said, ""Violence against police officers will not be tolerated,"" the updated memo says. ""We will prosecute any person who harms or attempts to harm a police officer.""A spokeswoman for Suozzi said their ad campaign ended Feb. 2, two days before Bragg issued the updated memo. The advertisement remained on Suozzi’s official Twitter account as of March 16. Because the ad aired before Bragg updated his policies, we will only consider its description of the initial policies for our Truth-O-Meter rating. ""The fact is that the Manhattan district attorney put out a ‘day one’ memo stating that his office would not prosecute some crimes, including some armed robberies and resisting arrest, and the Suozzi campaign aired an ad highlighting Bragg’s new policies,"" said Kim Devlin, a senior advisor to the Suozzi campaign, told PolitiFact New York. Our rulingSuozzi’s ad said, ""The Manhattan DA is actually proposing to downgrade armed robbery to a misdemeanor, and to stop prosecuting resisting arrest.""Suozzi was referencing Bragg’s initial announcement of new policies on prosecuting, or declining to prosecute, certain offenses.Bragg did lay out changes to his office’s policy on prosecuting armed robberies and resisting arrest in his initial memo.

Facilities for breeding pigs would need to provide more than 24 square feet of usable floor space per pig. The law would ban the sale of pork, egg and veal products from companies whose facilities don’t meet those standards. The law applies to the sale of uncooked pork from animals raised in California and out of state. Proposition 12 was put on California’s ballot on Nov. 6, 2018, and passed with roughly 62% of the vote. The law amends requirements in parts of Chapter 13.8 of the state’s Health and Safety Code. It adds Proposition 2, a law that involved prevents animal cruelty that passed in 2008. Parts of the law were phased in, with the part covering requirements for pigs taking effect on Jan. 1, 2022. However, a Sacramento County judge ruled on Jan. 24 to delay enforcing the law for six months for retailers and grocers until the state enacted final regulations for the law. The regulations still apply to pork producers. The law’s overall goal is to prevent cruel treatment of animals in agriculture.

111,D.L. Davis,"Says President Joe Biden ""is trying to send taxpayer dollars to manufacturers overseas that do not abide by the same (carbon emission) standards we do at home.""","The ""America First"" doctrine was a central part of Republican President Donald Trump’s administration, with some lawmakers rallying around Trump’s approach to international relations, including skepticism of international organizations and trade deals. Now, with Democrat Joe Biden in the White House, U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wisconsin, argues the opposite is happening when it comes to efforts to address climate change.. In a Feb. 3, 2022 tweet, Grothman said: ""The US has made strides in reducing carbon emissions that other parts of the world have not. Meanwhile, @POTUS is trying to send taxpayer dollars to manufacturers overseas that do not abide by the same standards we do at home.""We previously checked the first part of the claim, on the U.S. making progress even as some other countries have not, and rated it True. For this fact check, we are focused on the second part of the claim: Biden trying to send taxpayer dollars overseas to high-pollution countries.Is Grothman right?China and manufacturingIn this case, China – the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases – plays a key role, particularly as it relates to some of the products being boosted by Bidens plan.When asked for backup, Grothman’s staff cited an Oct. 22, 2021 Solar Reviews article that stated two-thirds of all solar panels are made in China, and an April 17, 2021 CNBC report that said China also dominates the rare mineral market.(According to the U.S. Geological Survey, in 2019, China was responsible for 80% of rare earths imports.) This is what the CNBC report had to say about their importance and use:""Once extracted from mines, rare earths are shipped to separation facilities, where they are separated from other minerals. Then rare earths are individually separated into oxides, metals and finally magnets that are used in everything from missiles to wind turbines, medical devices, power tools, cellphones and motors for hybrid and electric vehicles.""Grothman’s team connected that dominance by China with Biden’s stalled Build Back Better plan, which includes increases in energy tax credits for solar, wind, geothermal, waste, fuel cell, and energy storage technologies. The implication is that subsidies for the purchase of solar panels, and other items that include rare earth minerals, means that tax dollars would be on the way to Chinese manufacturers.This is where Grothman’s claim runs into problems. Featured Fact-checkAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezstated on January 27, 2023 in an interview with reporters“The largest contributor to the debt ceiling, or to our deficit, has been the Trump tax cuts.”By Louis Jacobson • February 1, 2023First, in its phrasing – ""trying to send"" – the claim suggests a primary objective of the Biden plan is to send the money overseas. That ignores the fact the Build Back Better plan includes a ""Made in America"" provision to make products manufactured here a priority, as well as a plan to help make the U.S. a player in the rare earths supply chain. Indeed, ""Made in America"" has been a hallmark of Biden’s presidency.For instance, in his March 1, 2022, State of the Union address, Biden declared:""There’s been a law on the books for almost a century to make sure taxpayers’ dollars support American jobs and businesses. Every Administration says they’ll do it, but we are actually doing it. We will buy American to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails are made in America."" That’s all great in theory. But how does it work in practice?Abdur Chowdhury, professor emeritus in economics at Marquette University, noted that ""in global geopolitics, you cannot always achieve what you want."" ""As China controls the global supply of rare earth minerals, it is true that some U.S. taxpayer dollars would go to high polluting nations like China, India,"" Chowdhury said. ""So the U.S. has to participate in various global climate change negotiations in order to force these countries to reduce environmental pollution.""He added: ""Withdrawing from the international discussion and negotiation on a number of environmental issues is not the answer.

112,Elizabeth Egan,“More white legacy students get admitted to top universities than Black & Latinx students admitted through affirmative action.”,"U.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman, a Democrat who represents New York's 16th District, recently tweeted a comment about admissions equity at selective universities, an issue he’s currently seeking to address with legislation.""More white legacy students get admitted to top universities than Black & Latinx students admitted through affirmative action"" Bowman tweeted on Jan. 26. Bowman has introduced a bill with Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., to overhaul legacy and donor admissions practices at universities. The Fair College Admissions for Students Act would amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to prevent colleges and universities that participate in federal student aid programs from offering admissions preferences to children of alumni or donors.While Bowman has a point that white students do benefit significantly from legacy admissions, his tweet includes some imprecise phrasing and oversimplifies some recent research.When we asked Patsy Montesinos, a spokesperson for Bowman, for the evidence to support the tweet, she said it was based on an opinion article by Deborah Archer, president of the American Civil Liberties Union, published in Bloomberg Law, and a 2019 study, ""Legacy and Athlete Preferences at Harvard,"" by three academics for the National Bureau of Economic Research. Here, we will focus on the academic paper since it was the only one that offered new, specific data. When we reached out to the co-authors of the academic paper, one of them, Tyler Ransom, a University of Oklahoma economist, took issue with how Bowman’s tweet was worded.The paper is based on data that emerged from a lawsuit against Harvard University over alleged discrimination against Asian American applicants. As part of the lawsuit, Harvard provided unusual access to data underlying admissions decisions for specific types of applicants, including recruited athletes, legacy students (that is, those who are children of alumni), the children of faculty and staff, and the children of major donors. The paper analyzed this data.For starters, the paper studied admissions patterns at Harvard — not at all ""top universities.""Ransom also took issue with Bowman’s phrasing, which could be read to suggest that white legacy admissions exceed the combination of Black and Latino affirmative action admissions.Featured Fact-checkMarjorie Taylor Greenestated on February 1, 2023 in a House committee hearingIllinois “received $5.1 billion at an elementary school there that used it for equity and diversity.”By Jeff Cercone • February 3, 2023In reality, the paper’s analysis estimated that, collectively, the number of Blacks and Latino admitted as a result of affirmative action was higher than the number of white legacy admissions. Only when the number of Black affirmative action admits was compared individually to the number of white legacy admits, or when the number of Latino affirmative action admits was compared individually to the number of white legacy admits, did the number of legacy admits exceed the number of affirmative action admits.Bowman’s office also shared a memorandum that criticized legacy preferences. The memorandum, written by the advocacy group Education Reform Now, cited data from Princeton University’s admission statistics from 2021. The data listed indicate that legacy students made up 13% of admits, Blacks made up 8%, and Latinos made up 11%.This shows the same pattern: Collectively, Black and Hispanic admits exceeded the number of legacy admits, even though individually, each group’s admission numbers were outpaced by legacy students.When looking at this data, It’s worth noting a few factors that complicate the conclusions that can be drawn. First, Black and Hispanic admits from the Princeton data may also be legacy admits. Second, it’s impossible to know whether some of the white legacy admits would have been admitted even without their legacy status. And third, not all of the Black and Latino Princeton admits would have been the beneficiary of affirmative action.When we presented our reporting to Bowman's office, Alex Foley, a legislative aide, acknowledged that drawing conclusions about the data can be difficult. However, he added that ""many top universities do enroll more legacy students"" than they do Black or Latino students.Our rulingBowman said, ""More white legacy students get admitted to top universities than Black & Latinx students admitted through affirmative action.""There is evidence that legacy students do get an unusually large benefit in the elite college admissions process but the data is quite limited. And, recent data suggests some complications in drawing comparisons between the admission rates of various groups. These complications include the reality that some admits are both minorities and legacies. It's also hard to say what share of white legacy admits and Black and Latino admits received preferences from their legacy status or from affirmative action, respectively.We rate the statement Half True.",Jamaal Bowman,"March 7, 2022",half-true

Mike Lee, R-Utah, wrote in an article cited by Gibbons’ campaign that while the sanctions are ""an impressive effort overall, the sanctions also have a glaring weakness: They largely spare Russia’s all-important energy sector, the backbone of its entire economy, and its agricultural center — the country is a major wheat exporter.""Russia expert Harley Balzer, an emeritus professor of government and international affairs at Georgetown University, told PolitiFact that Biden ""is endeavoring to balance punishing Russia and preventing serious damage in Europe from rising energy prices and threatened supplies.""""The financial sanctions are causing havoc on the Russian stock market, causing the market cap of major Russian firms to drop more than 90% on foreign exchanges and clobbering the ruble,"" he added. ""Freezing the Russian Central Bank assets abroad reduced their reserves from $600 billion to $300 billion. They are spending $5 billion to $10 billion per day to keep the ruble from depreciating even more. Cronies' assets are being confiscated at an increasing pace.

However, until recently, state health officials recommended that students wear masks and many school districts required them.COVID-19 infections have declined since late January, prompting Republican lawmakers to push a bill that would block school mask mandates altogether. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper later vetoed it. During a Feb. 17 debate on the state House floor, Rep. David Willis, R-Union County, rose with a microphone to praise his local school leaders for their move to make masks optional.""As of today in Union County — after being threatened that we were killing kids and killing teachers and killing staff and running people off — there are exactly zero students, staff, members, teachers, bus drivers, cafeteria workers, yard workers, maintenance people, delivery people, anyone in Union County in the hospital related to our school system with COVID,"" Willis said.This made us wonder: Who has criticized Union County school policies, and was Willis right about the Union school district’s hospitalization numbers?On the day Willis spoke, his comments accurately reflected the number of Union school district employees and students hospitalized with COVID-19. However, it’s misleading for Willis to suggest that there are no hospitalizations among people ""related to"" the Union County Public School system, since the term is so vague that it isn’t quantifiable. His comments also gloss over the reasons why the Union County school system has faced criticism.Willis’ commentsPolitiFact NC reached out to Union County Public Schools on Feb. 17, shortly after Willis spoke on the state House floor.

On Sept. 16, North Carolina’s health department sent a letter to board members. It emphasized that student and staff quarantines were required by law—not merely a recommendation—and pointed out that the board’s action came at a time when the number of COVID cases in Union County were disproportionally high:""Children under 18 are being hit particularly hard and now have the highest rate of cases in the state for the first time in the pandemic. Children in Union County are among the most impacted. Union County had the third-highest number of COVID-19 cases in the state for children under 18 for the week ending Sept. 11. This rate is substantially higher than counties of similar size and population, including Cumberland, Cabarrus and Durham.""The health department is led by a secretary who was picked by Cooper, a Democrat.

That budget was introduced by then-Mayor Tom Barrett and passed by the council while Barrett was still in office.The budget office was still expecting an overall decrease of about two-dozen officer positions in 2022, even with the additional 195.After the vote, when he was still presiding as Common Council president, Johnson described it this way: ""We maintained (Milwaukee Police Department) strength.""Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 26, 2023 in a postThe officers who beat Tyre Nichols targeted him because he was “allegedly dating” one of their wives.By Madison Czopek • February 1, 2023Keep that phrasing in mind as we look deeper.Digging in to the claimThere are really two parts of the claim by Johnson: That he led the fight for the new officers and whether those officers can fairly be described as ""new,"" which suggests an increase in the size of the force.When we asked Johnson for backup, his campaign adviser, Sachin Chheda, cited two things: The 195 officers added in the budget and an additional 30 hired through what is known as a COPS grant – federal money that was meant to bring on new officers to facilitate the reassignment of experienced officers to task forces related to a federal program to address violent crime.The 2020 COPS Hiring Program Grant – a three-year grant that provides 30 new police officers – went through a drawn-out legislative process between 2020 and 2021. The file failed when it was before the Common Council, but it was then reconsidered and approved and later signed by Barrett on Jan. 19, 2021.While Johnson was not the sponsor – the Barrett-administration was – he consistently voted in favor of the grant while it was in front of the Common Council.As for the 195 officers, those, too, were requested by Barrett. He proposed spending $6 million in American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds for the three recruit classes instead of putting the cost on the tax levy.Johnson put forward legislation during the ARPA deliberations and the subsequent fall budget process to fund the 195 officer positions in 2022.Said Chheda: ""Without his leadership, the city would have seen more than 200 fewer officers on the street. He will continue to address public safety as his top priority in the weeks and months to come.""So, Johnson played an important role in assuring funding for the recruit classes. But in the TV ad, viewers may be left with the impression the size of the force increased, since it talks about ""new"" officers ""to make our city safer.""And the bottom line is that the measure will maintain the department’s strength, not increase it.Our rulingIn a TV ad, Johnson claimed that he ""led the fight to add 200 new police officers to make our city safer.""Johnson played an important role in the approval of 195 recruits, as well as the officers covered by the 2020 COPS grant. But based on expected retirements, those recruits will simply maintain the department’s size, not increase it.We rate the claim Half True.  window.gciAnalyticsUAID = 'PMJS-TEALIUM-COBRAND';window.gciAnalyticsLoadEvents = false;window.gciAnalytics.view({    'event-type': 'pageview',    'content-type': 'interactives',    'content-ssts-section': 'news',    'content-ssts-subsection': 'news:politics',    'content-ssts-topic': 'news:politics:politifactwisconsin',    'content-ssts-subtopic': ' news:politics:politifactwisconsin'});",Cavalier Johnson,"February 23, 2022",half-true
120,D.L. Davis,"""48-Hour waiting periods limit crimes of passion and keep our communities safe.”","On Feb. 2, 2016, Caroline Nosal, 24, of Stoughton, was shot to death by a 26-year-old former co-worker outside the grocery store where she worked – and from where the assailant was suspended, then fired for harassing Nosal. Exactly six years later, her father, James Nosal, spoke at a Madison news conference where a pair of Democratic lawmakers announced a bill that would reinstate a 48-hour waiting period on handgun purchases in Wisconsin. In 2015, then-Gov. Scott Walker signed a bill repealing the nearly 40-year-old provision, arguing that it was outdated because background checks could now be performed so much faster than before.In pushing for a renewed 48-hour period at the news conference, James Nosal asked of the man who killed his daughter: ""If he had had to wait 48 hours, would he have rethought his plan?"" State Rep. Shelia Stubbs, D-Madison, is sponsoring the bill — which is a longshot in the Republican-controlled Legislature – with state Sen. Melissa Agard, D-Madison.According to an analysis of current law by the Legislative Reference Bureau, before a federally licensed firearms dealer may transfer a handgun after a sale, the dealer must have the Department of Justice perform a background check to determine if the purchaser is prohibited from possessing a firearm under federal or state law.Under the proposal — AB1059 in the Assembly and SB1003,1,2 in the Senate — the dealer would be prohibited from transferring the handgun until 48 hours after the background check was requested. In a Feb. 2 tweet, Stubbs described the need this way:""48-Hour waiting periods limit crimes of passion and keep our communities safe. Every weapon has the ability to permanently impact individuals, families, and entire communities. Without a waiting period, we allow impulsive decisions to result in terrible consequences."" We’re interested in the first sentence: Do such waiting periods ""limit crimes of passion and keep our communities safe""? And, if so, what research supports it?Waiting periods and keeping communities safeWhen asked for backup, Stubbs cited a 2017 study published by researchers from the Harvard Business School that examined the impact of waiting periods in the United States from 1970 to 2014. According to the study, waiting periods reduced firearm homicides by 17% and states with waiting periods avoided around 750 homicides per year.Stubbs also cited a 2018 Behavioral Scientist article, ""The Case for Handgun Waiting Periods,"" by the same researchers who noted that ""research from behavioral economics and psychology has found that intense emotions like anger and sadness — ‘visceral factors,’ in academic language — can cause people to take actions they later regret, such as resorting to gun violence.""The researcher went on to say that those intense emotions are often transitory.""Given sufficient time to cool off, the types of intense negative emotions that lead to violent tendencies can pass,"" the researchers wrote. ""This suggests that inserting even a short delay in the gun-buying process has the potential to reduce gun violence, without restricting anyone’s right to own a gun."" Finally, she cited a Wisconsin-focused study, published Feb. 21, 2021, that examined suicide rates in the wake of the repeal of the waiting period in Wisconsin. Using state mortality data, the researchers concluded that the repeal ""correlated with the increase of firearm-related suicides among Wisconsin residents of color and Wisconsinites residing in urban counties."" John Gross, a clinical associate professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Law, told us it can be hard to determine how a particular policy change, such as waiting periods, impacts crime rates or public safety. Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 26, 2023 in a postThe officers who beat Tyre Nichols targeted him because he was “allegedly dating” one of their wives.By Madison Czopek • February 1, 2023""When it comes to waiting periods, older studies have shown mixed results,"" he said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""Some have shown a small decrease in gun violence while others found no correlation between waiting periods and gun violence.""Thomas Leager, executive director of Waupaca-based Wisconsin Gun Owners Inc., argued that a waiting period does not by itself stop a crime, particularly if a gun is bought ""off the black market."" (Indeed, in Wisconsin, and many other states, background checks are not required for purchase of any guns from sellers who are not federally licensed dealers. This is the ""loophole"" that gun-control activists often cite — sales between friends, online or unlicensed dealers at gun shows).Leager also noted that a waiting period could prevent people from getting a gun in time to protect themselves: ""A waiting period for a woman who is being stalked or harassed could literally be deadly."" Setting the rhetoric aside, when it comes to the ""keeping communities safe"" aspect of the claim, there are studies that support Stubbs’ claim, but there are many situations where a gun could still be obtained without any such wait. So, that information is missing.Waiting periods and ""crimes of passion""Stubbs’ claim is more problematic when it comes to her assertion that waiting periods would reduce ""crimes of passion."" On the surface, it would seem obvious: If you don’t have a gun at the time, you can’t shoot someone in that moment.But the very definition, a ""crime of passion"" involves an illegal action committed in the heat of the moment in response to provocation (as opposed to an illegal act that was premeditated or deliberate). So if a gun were involved in such an incident, the perpetrator would already have it.Gross, the University of Wisconsin-Madison professor, noted that recent studies have found a correlation between waiting periods and a reduction in suicides. ""The most common form of gun violence is actually suicide,"" he wrote. ""So, if Rep. Stubbs is including suicide as a ‘crime of passion,’ which the correlation between delaying the purchase of a gun and decreased suicide rates suggests it is, then the statement is true.""At the same time, Gross noted that many believe suicide should not be considered a crime, so designating it as a ""crime of passion"" could be misleading. Finally, he said, there is plenty of evidence that the presence of a gun in a home significantly increases the chances that one partner will commit homicide. ""For example, one study showed that direct access to guns during a domestic violence incident increases the likelihood of a female victim’s homicide compared to other acts of violence by 11 times,"" Gross said. ""What we don’t know is whether a waiting period significantly impacts the rate of gun ownership over the long term, which would then reduce the number of homes where there was a gun and, consequently, would reduce the rate of intimate partner violence or ‘crimes of passion.’ ""Our rulingStubbs claimed ""48-Hour waiting periods limit crimes of passion and keep our communities safe.""Some studies have shown reductions in homicides in states with a waiting period, but many guns are obtained illegally or through sellers where background checks are not required. Meanwhile, ""crimes of passion,"" by their very definition, happen in the moment, so if a gun were involved in such cases, the perpetrator would already have it. That said, studies show a waiting period can reduce suicides.So, there is some evidence for both parts of the claim, as well as factors that muddy the water.For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.  window.gciAnalyticsUAID = 'PMJS-TEALIUM-COBRAND';window.gciAnalyticsLoadEvents = false;window.gciAnalytics.view({    'event-type': 'pageview',    'content-type': 'interactives',    'content-ssts-section': 'news',    'content-ssts-subsection': 'news:politics',    'content-ssts-topic': 'news:politics:politifactwisconsin',    'content-ssts-subtopic': ' news:politics:politifactwisconsin'});",Shelia Stubbs,"February 18, 2022",half-true
121,Paul Specht,Republican state Sens. Paul Newton and Warren Daniel “refused to even give testimony” in North Carolina’s latest redistricting case.,"Some North Carolina Democrats say gerrymandering efforts were ""worse"" in the state Senate than in the state House, in part because two Republican senators didn’t testify during a recent redistricting trial.North Carolina legislators redraw the state voting maps every decade after new census data come out. The political party in power typically draws the districts to favor themselves, often  prompting lawsuits from critics. That happened again last year.Voting rights groups sued leaders in the Republican-led state House and state Senate, arguing their maps are unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders. A panel of Superior Court judges ruled in favor of the Republicans. So the plaintiffs then appealed to the state Supreme Court.On Jan. 31, ahead of oral arguments before the high court, the North Carolina House Democrats’ Twitter account tweeted:House Republicans ""admitted to secret maps and destruction of evidence,"" but Sens. Paul Newton and Warren Daniel ""refused to even give testimony. So the question is—what the hell was going on in the [state Senate] that was so much worse than what was happening in the House?""Republicans refuted the tweet. Senate Leader Phil Berger’s communications team called the Democrats’ claim ""evidence-free conspiracy theorizing.""There’s a lot to unpack in this tweet, which takes some facts from the redistricting case and frames them in a way that could lead some to think the lawmakers engaged in wrongdoing.First, a portion of the House Democrats’ claim about secret maps is accurate but some of it is difficult to prove. During the lower-court trial, Republican state Rep. Destin Hall said he and his staffers consulted secret ""concept"" maps while leading the chamber’s restricting process. He said the maps didn’t incorporate any racial or partisan gerrymanders. But it’s unclear whether the maps were intentionally destroyed. The defendants, in court documents, said only that the maps were ""were not saved, are currently lost and no longer exist."" While that may raise questions about records retention, it doesn’t prove that the maps were intentionally destroyed.The state Supreme Court overturned the maps on Feb. 4, and ten days later cited the concept maps in its full opinion.  One reason the N.C. House Democrats’ tweet stands out: the secret maps were on the House side—but the tweet makes claims about the Senate.As for Daniel and Newton testifying, it’s true that they declined to answer questions in a deposition. But it’s misleading to suggest their silence is indicative of wrongdoing, since they asked the court for—and were granted—protections offered by state laws.The tweet also could give some readers the impression that senate Republicans didn’t answer questions at all. That’s not the case. Sen. Ralph Hise, the highest-ranking co-chairman of the state Senate’s redistricting committee, was deposed and later testified on the third day of the Superior Court trial.Let’s review the facts.Legislative privilegeThe N.C. House Democrats’ Twitter account is run by the Democratic Party’s state House caucus. Featured Fact-checkTweetsstated on January 24, 2023 in a tweetDiamond and Silk pundit died from COVID-19By Paul Specht • February 6, 2023Amanda Eubanks, the caucus executive director, told PolitiFact NC the ""refused to testify"" claim is a reference to Daniel and Newton invoking ""legislative privilege,"" a state law that can protect legislators from having to provide information about some aspects of the lawmaking process. Before the redistricting trial, plaintiffs sought to depose Daniel, Newton, Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore, also a Republican. Those lawmakers cited legislative privilege and asked to be exempt from the depositions, a motion the court granted on Dec. 24.Once Daniel and Newton were exempted from depositions, they were viewed as ineligible to testify on the stand. So even if they wanted to testify in the trial, it’s unlikely that they would have been called upon. That said, the scope of legislative privilege is not well defined in state law. So, in a hypothetical case in which a legislator seeks to avoid questioning, a judge could compel a legislator to answer questions about details that aren’t protected by legislative immunity, lawyers told PolitiFact NC.""There are some things in public records like communications between legislators and legislative staff, or when they go to the research group and say, ‘If I propose this, is it legal?’ You’re not going to get it because it’s confidential,"" said Mike Tadych, a partner at law firm Stevens Martin Vaughn & Tadych PLLC, which represents the North Carolina Press Association.But in a trial, you typically ""can’t just assert legislative privilege because you’re a legislator and you don’t want to talk,"" said Kym Hunter, a senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center. ""Legislative privilege could apply potentially to certain parts of what they would be questioned about, but there’s certainly many, many aspects which wouldn't be subject to legislative privilege.""Voting rights group Common Cause, a plaintiff in the case, included Berger and Daniel on its witness list filing on Dec. 31—after the senators had already been granted legislative privilege. Common Cause didn’t call upon either senator during trial, but in court documents the group said it ""reserves the right to challenge legislative privilege on appeal.""‘Worse’ than the House?The N.C. House Democrats’ tweet implies that silence by Daniel and Newton is indicative that the Senate’s behavior was somehow ""worse"" than that of Republicans in the House. The accusation is vague and hard to quantify without more information about what action is being measured. When it comes to alleged gerrymandering, none of the three maps drawn by Republican lawmakers stand out as being significantly more partisan than the others. Experts at Princeton University reviewed the state House, state Senate and the congressional maps, giving each an ""F"" grade, due to ""significant Republican advantage."" We asked Eubanks what N.C. House Democrats meant by the statement, and she never directly answered the question.Hise, meanwhile, testified that the state Senate and House redistricting processes were ""very different."" Hise noted that he, Daniel and Newton used the same staff assistance provided by Berger’s office. He said he wasn’t aware of any secret maps being used on the Senate side because all maps were required to be drawn in public view. Hise acknowledged that he never issued a specific directive banning staff from looking at concept maps outside of public view—something state Supreme Court justices noted in their recent opinion—but he said aides were aware of the rules.While the N.C. House Democrats’ tweet raises questions about the senate process, Berger spokeswoman Lauren Horsch noted that Hise’s testimony wasn’t disputed in court. She added that Hise testified—and the others didn’t—in part because the trial was under time constraints.Our rulingThe N.C. House Democrats’ Twitter account said Newton and Daniel ""refused to even give testimony"" in North Carolina’s redistricting case. ""So the question is—what the hell was going on in the [state Senate] that was so much worse than what was happening in the House?""It’s true that they did not give testimony. But that’s because the senators invoked a legal protection called ""legislative privilege"" that allowed them to opt out of answering questions in the case. That move alone doesn’t necessarily mean they have something to hide. The tweet is partially accurate but leaves out important details, which is our definition of Half True.",North Carolina state House Democratic Caucus,"February 17, 2022",half-true

But its claim about potency against cancer cells incorrectly equates a molecule found in that fungus with a drug derived from the molecule.What is this fungus?Although the post doesn’t mention the fungus by name, we ran a Google reverse image search and found that the photo showed a fungus called Ophiocordyceps sinensis, or the caterpillar fungus.Only found 10,000 feet above sea level in the Tibetan Plateau and Himalayas, the fungus acts as a parasite by infecting the larvae of ghost moths and sprouting from the head of the dead insect, according to Insider.Because it’s located in a remote region and is harvested by hand, the fungus is rare, and a single gram of it can cost from $30 to $125, Insider reported. That’s as much as $3,500 an ounce.Demand for the fungus has risen over the years, as it’s used often in traditional Asian medicine for its supposed immunity boosting power. The fungus has been used to treat a variety of maladies, including cancer, according to The Atlantic. It’s also used often as an aphrodisiac, and has been called the ""Himalayan Viagra.""  Featured Fact-checkKayleigh McEnanystated on February 7, 2023 in a Facebook post""Joe Biden's wide open southern border"" is to blame for fentanyl deaths in the U.S.By Jeff Cercone • February 10, 2023Is it a cancer killer?The post claims a molecule in the fungus can kill cancer cells with ""40 times the potency."" It doesn’t provide much context for the potency claim or explain what it’s comparing the molecule to. There is a basis for that number, but the post describes it incorrectly.Researchers at the University of Oxford announced in October that they were working with the United Kingdom drug company NuCana to develop a chemotherapy drug derived from the fungus.Researchers found the fungus contained a natural nucleoside analogue, a type of antiviral compound used in therapeutic drugs, which has cancer-killing properties. But the compound breaks down in the blood quickly, and only a small amount of it is ever delivered to a tumor, researchers said.NuCana was able to design a drug derived from the compound that researchers said was longer-lasting and had a ""40 times greater potency for killing cancer cells"" than what’s found naturally in the fungus, the University of Oxford reported.Testing of the drug’s cancer-killing power has primarily been in a laboratory setting, but preliminary results from Phase I clinical trials have shown ""encouraging signals of anti-cancer activity"" in people who have received it, according to an article published by the researchers.Phase II trials are underway and involve testing the drug's possible impact on solid tumors and lymphoma. The trial is expected to be completed by July.Despite its use in traditional medicine as a cancer treatment and the research into its antiviral properties, the National Cancer Institute said the fungus is currently ""not an approved treatment for any type of cancer.""Since the drug is still in the early clinical trial phase, and its potency was only measured in a laboratory setting, it's still far away from being a breakthrough in cancer treatment as suggested in the Facebook post. Our rulingA Facebook post claims a molecule found in a Himalayan fungus can kill cancer with ""40 times the potency.""The fungus, known as Ophiocordyceps sinensis, has been used in traditional Asian medicine to treat a variety of illnesses including cancer. Researchers in the United Kingdom have found that the fungus contains an antiviral compound that has anti-cancer effects.

A Chambers press release cited a statistic from 2016, but as of 2020 slightly fewer Black Americans were blocked from voting. The majority of those who can’t vote due to a felony conviction are no longer in prison.Chambers, a social justice advocate from Baton Rouge, is running in a Democratic primary with hopes of ousting U.S. Sen. John Kennedy, a Republican.Banning felons from voting is a relic of racial segregation lawsBefore the passage of the 15th Amendment, which guaranteed men the right to vote regardless of race, very few states barred prisoners from voting, a lawyer at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University previously told PolitiFact. But after the post-Civil War amendment passed, a wave of states enacted laws or amendments to take away prisoners’ right to vote. President Joe Biden campaigned on a promise to incentivize states to restore felon voting rights. His efforts so far have stalled amid Republican opposition in the Senate to set uniform voting rights laws, including for felons once they leave prison. That means states have the power to set their own voting laws.During the past decade, the trend has turned toward making it easier for felons to regain their right to vote after leaving prison. Proponents argue that after felons pay their debt to society, they should be allowed to positively contribute to society by voting. Opponents say that those who break the law should not easily earn back the right to vote. Each state sets its own rules on whether and when felons regain the right to voteA press release from the Chambers campaign showed that he pulled the statistic from a 2020  Brookings Institution report. That document linked to a 2016 report by the Sentencing Project, a group that supports expanding voting rights. It was based on data collected by sociologists with the University of Minnesota and the University of Georgia. In 2016, the Sentencing Project found that one in 13 African Americans of voting age was disenfranchised, a rate more than four times greater than that of non-African Americans. In 2020, the figure fell to 1 in 16 Black Americans. It includes people who have served their sentence, are on probation or parole, or remain in prison.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 18, 2023 in a Facebook postDocument shows that Hunter Biden paid Joe Biden $50,000 a month in rent.By Samantha Putterman • January 19, 2023The numbers of disenfranchised felons fell between 2016 and 2020 as more states made it easier for some felons to regain the right to vote including California, Iowa, New York, New Jersey, Nevada, Colorado, Wyoming and Washington, D.C.There is variation among states on how many felons — of all races and ethnicities — are disenfranchised, because each Legislature or governor sets its own rules. In sheer numbers, Florida has the highest number of disenfranchised felons. In 2018, Florida voters approved a constitutional amendment that restored voting rights to people with past felony convictions, but subsequent legislation required that they fulfill other conditions of their sentence first, such as paying restitution and court costs. In Maine, Vermont and now Washington, D.C., felons don’t lose their right to vote, according to a 2021 analysis by the National Conference of State Legislatures. In 21 states, felons lose their voting rights only while incarcerated, and regain their right to vote upon release. In the remainder of the states, felons also lose their voting rights while on parole and/or probation or have to meet other conditions to regain their right to vote. Our rulingChambers said in a campaign video ""one in 13 Black Americans are deprived of the right to vote."" Chambers’ video didn’t explain why they are deprived of the right to vote. But he was referring to the number of African Americans who lost the right to vote due to a felony conviction, based on a 2016 analysis from the Sentencing Project.A  2020 report by the same group found that number dropped slightly to 1 in 16 African Americans. It includes people who have served their sentence, are on probation or parole, or remain in prison.Chambers’ overall point that a significant number of Black people are disenfranchised due to a felony conviction is correct, but in an environment where issues of voter suppression are widely discussed and debated, the figure benefits from more explanation.

The bill was proposed as St. Louis leaders entered their fourth year of negotiations with Chinese officials over a freight hub at the airport, and two months after the Chinese directed their largest freight carrier — China Cargo Airlines — to begin direct talks with the airport, the story said.Schmitt argued at the time that the tax credits would be issued only if certain investment and trade occurred. His bill called for $420 million of incentives to build warehouses and distribution centers within a 50-mile radius of Lambert; and $60 million in tax credits for companies shipping exports out of Missouri. Schmitt said facilities built under the bill could be used to store meat that could be sent to China.Without the bill, Schmitt didn’t see the China hub materializing, the St. Louis Beacon reported.The Team PAC ad didn’t mention the hub’s potential to handle exports, but one of the articles it cited, a St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorial, said the City of St. Louis was negotiating with China Cargo Airlines ""to bring Chinese-made goods to America through Lambert and to take American goods and agricultural products back overseas.""To back its claim that the airline was ""owned by China's Communist Party,"" the super PAC ad cited a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing for 2011 by Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines, in connection with securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange.The 2011 filing does not make clear the precise level of Chinese government ownership in China Cargo. Here’s what it does say:Most of the major airline companies in China were majority-owned either by the central government or by provincial or municipal governments in China.The Chinese government controlled a 59.53% equity stake in a holding company that was China Eastern’s biggest shareholder.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 13, 2023 in a post“MRNA vaccines are being injected into our food supply.”By Tom Kertscher • January 23, 2023China Eastern owned 51% of ""subsidiary"" China Cargo.So the filing indicates that the Communist government had at least an indirect stake in China Cargo.Under the version ultimately approved by the Missouri legislature, Schmitt’s bill would have provided $360 million in tax credits. But the bill was not signed into law, and the project was scrapped.Loosening of Missouri farmland lawThe second part of the claim alludes to a 2013 state law, which Schmitt voted for, on the ownership of agricultural land by foreign businesses. Before the law, foreign businesses generally were prohibited from owning agricultural land in Missouri; the change loosened the prohibition, capping foreign ownership at 1% of Missouri’s total agricultural acreage. The measure was approved over the veto of then-Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat.The law allowed a Chinese company, Shuanghui International of Hong Kong, to buy Virginia-based Smithfield Foods, which owned Missouri farmland at the time, the Post-Dispatch reported. But what Schmitt voted for was not approval of any specific land purchases by China.China as a key campaign issueChina is a recurring theme in ads for Senate contests in several states. In a race for an open seat in Pennsylvania, Dr. Mehmet Oz accused fellow Republican David McCormick of giving Chinese companies billions of dollars through the hedge fund he ran. A super PAC supporting Republican Josh Mandel for an open seat in Ohio claimed that Republican Jane Timken’s family business moved jobs to China. Meanwhile, Alex Lasry, one of the Democrats challenging GOP incumbent Ron Johnson in Wisconsin, pledged to ""finally stand up to China.""The Missouri race is to succeed two-term GOP Sen. Roy Blunt, who is not seeking re-election. The primary is Aug. 2 for the seat, which is rated as solid Republican.Greitens resigned as governor in 2018 after facing a felony computer tampering charge, which was dropped, and allegations related to an extramarital affair. Schmitt formerly served as Missouri’s secretary of state and as a state senator. The other GOP candidates include U.S. Reps. Vicky Hartzler and Billy Long; Long’s campaign gained attention for running an ad claiming that Democrats ""rigged"" the 2020 presidential election. Also among the GOP candidates are state Senate President Dave Schatz and attorney Mark McCloskey, who is best known for pointing a gun at protesters when they marched past his St. Louis home. Team PAC and mega donor UihleinTeam PAC raised $2.5 million in 2021, according to the Federal Election Commission — all of it from a suburban Chicago billionaire, Republican donor Richard Uihlein. Uihlein, who owns a giant shipping supply company, is the second-largest individual donor to outside spending groups for the 2022 campaign cycle, having contributed $10.2 million, according to the nonprofit Open Secrets.As a super PAC, Team PAC may raise unlimited sums of money from corporations, unions, associations and individuals, then spend unlimited sums to advocate for or against political candidates.Our rulingTeam PAC said Schmitt ""sponsored a bill to spend $480 million of your tax dollars to create a cargo hub here for airlines owned by China's Communist Party"" and ""voted to let China buy up Missouri farmland.""Schmitt’s 2011 bill initially called for $480 million in tax credits, not state expenditures, for a proposed air cargo hub to support international trade, including exports, with a Chinese airline as a potential partner; the tax credits would have been contingent on investment and trade occurring. The bill did not become law.Schmitt’s vote for a 2013 bill that became law allowed for foreign businesses to own a limited amount of agricultural land in Missouri.The statement is based on bills that Schmitt supported in the legislature, but it leaves out important context about his vote and the effect of the legislation.

127,D.L. Davis,"“In 2021, 65 people in Milwaukee have lost their lives due to reckless driving accidents, and more than 9,000 cars have been stolen, double the amount in 2020.”","Stolen cars and the reckless driving that follows have climbed to the top of the worry list for Milwaukee residents who are now facing the first open mayoral race since 2004. A primary is scheduled for Feb. 15, with the spring election April 5.Acting Mayor Cavalier Johnson, who is among seven candidates, unveiled a plan in a Dec. 21, 2021 news release dubbed S.T.A.N.D. for Safer Streets. City officials say the plan focuses on: Safe street design Traffic enforcement Accountability Neighborhood Engagement  Demand progress It includes physical road improvements; stepped-up police enforcement, a new policy for towing unregistered or unlicensed vehicle operators who are caught driving at dangerous speeds; and a staff member in the mayor’s office to coordinate the plan across city departments and work with residents and businesses. ""As a parent of three children in Milwaukee, and someone who drives these streets daily, I find the statistics around automobile accidents and vehicle thefts unacceptable,"" Johnson said. At the time, Johnson was the incoming mayor, since Mayor Tom Barrett — who had been confirmed as U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg – had not yet resigned. Johnson was sworn in as acting mayor two days later.The news release went on to state that ""in 2021, 65 people in Milwaukee lost their lives due to reckless driving accidents, and more than 9,000 cars were stolen, double the amount in 2020."" Let’s examine both parts of the claim.Reckless drivingWhen asked for supporting data to back up Johnson’s statement, city staffers directed our  attention to Milwaukee Police Department Traffic Safety Unit statistics. According to Milwaukee Police Department data, the city had 66 traffic fatalities in 2021 (as of Feb. 3, 2022, there had been six).Johnson’s news release cited a figure of 65, so obviously one additional fatality occurred between that date and Dec. 31, 2021. But there is an important factor that gums up the claim: Johnson’s news release is citing reckless driving fatalities, while the Milwaukee Police Department statistics simply cite traffic fatalities.  Here is the department’s breakdown on traffic fatalities for 2021:Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 19, 2023 in a videoThe Transportation Security Administration spent “a couple hundred million dollars” on gender-neutral screening technology.By Gabrielle Settles • January 27, 202366 individuals were killed in fatal crashesThere were 61 fatal crash incidentsBut only 38 of the 61 of the crashes involved reckless driving (62%)The 38 reckless vehicle crashes resulted in 43 fatalities. ""The fact that dozens of people died in such crashes verifies the seriousness of the problem,"" said Jeff Fleming, communications director for the mayor’s office, in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""Nevertheless, we overstated last year’s reckless driving death toll.""As a point of reference, Karen Domagalski, operations manager at the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office, said there were 87 motor vehicle accident deaths in 2021 throughout the county, so deaths in accidents in the city accounted for nearly 76% percent of those. In Milwaukee, residents have increasingly raised concerns about reckless driving. Here is just a sampling of those incidents from 2021:June 16, 2021: A 16-year-old boy was killed and five other teens were hospitalized when police attempted to stop a stolen vehicle on the 9900 block of West Good Hope Road, but the driver instead led officers on a chase and eventually crossed over into oncoming traffic, hitting another vehicle head-on at 50 to 60 miles an hour. August 15, 2021: A car that was speeding and disregarding red traffic signals at 2:07 a.m. struck a Milwaukee County bus in the 2700 block of West Wisconsin Ave. The passenger of the car, a 38-year-old man, died from his injuries. The driver, a 28-year-old man, was hospitalized in stable condition after suffering life-threatening injuries. August 15, 2021: A Milwaukee woman and man were killed in a crash after two vehicles were drag racing at North 76th Street and West Silver Spring Drive around 7:10 p.m. and one vehicle struck a vehicle that had not been racing. Inside that other vehicle was a 66-year-old Milwaukee man and a 21-year-old Milwaukee woman. Both died on scene, police said.August 29, 2021: A 16-year-old boy was killed and three other teens, ranging in age from 15 to 17, were critically injured in a single-vehicle crash when the driver lost control and struck a tree about 3:30 p.m. in the 3100 block of North 20th Street, police said. Footage from TV news stations shows the damaged car ended up on the grounds of Union Cemetery. Stolen vehiclesThe second part of the claim is more straightforward. Johnson’s news release said more than 9,000 cars were stolen, double the amount in 2020. According to Milwaukee Police Department Crime Maps and Statistics, there were 4,508 thefts of motor vehicles in 2020, and the total by year’s end in 2021 was 10,482, an increase of 133%.So he is on the money there.Our rulingJohnson claimed that ""In 2021, 65 people in Milwaukee have lost their lives due to reckless driving accidents, and more than 9,000 cars have been stolen, double the amount in 2020.""Johnson was correct with the stolen vehicle part of the claim, but was off on the deaths due to reckless driving. The number cited by Johnson was for all traffic fatalities.

128,Amy Sherman,"“In Texas, because of the laws they passed, a 95-year-old World War II veteran is being denied the right to vote by mail because he can't produce a registration number he got back in the 1950s.”","Stacey Abrams, a Democrat running for Georgia governor, said on CNN that state legislators are passing laws to undermine democracy and keep voters from the ballot boxAbrams brought up a situation involving a Houston voter, Kenneth Thompson, who had been in the news for his attempts to get a mail ballot.""In Texas because of the laws they passed, a 95-year-old World War II veteran is being denied the right to vote by mail because he can't produce a registration number he got back in the 1950s,"" Abrams said Jan. 31 on CNN.She spoke prematurely. Thompson was eventually able to register to vote by mail, but it wasn’t easy. Thompson, who his daughter said has been voting since the 1940s, had to jump through hoops to apply for a mail ballot for the primary because of a new Texas law. It requires voters applying for mail ballots to provide ID information that matches that on their registration. That was a problem for Thompson because he registered to vote decades ago, back when the registration rules didn’t require such ID.A spokesperson for Abrams’ campaign, Seth Bringman, said the fact that Thompson will maybe be able to vote by mail after being denied twice, his daughter calling election officials and having to update his registration ""is the definition of a denial of his right.""""The hope that his right is restored after overcoming even more obstacles, and an assumption that everything will work out in the end, does not change that he is being denied this right, and is exactly the type of procedural hurdle — and mindset of those placing the procedural hurdles — applied throughout history to deny the right to vote, especially in states like Texas with a long history of discrimination,"" Bringman said.New Texas law adds ID requirements for requesting a mail ballotIn 2021, the Texas state Legislature passed a sweeping new elections law that requires voters applying for a mail ballot to include identifying numbers such as those on their driver’s license, state ID or the last four digits of their Social Security Number.If the number doesn’t match the number on file in their voter registration record — or if there is no such number on file — the application for a mail ballot must be rejected. The March 1 primary is the first statewide election under the new law. The provision has created a lot of confusion, including for voters who don’t remember what ID information they put on their registration — or, if in a case such as Thompson’s, they lack ID information on their registration.As of Jan. 29, Harris County rejected about 10% of mail ballot applications due to the new ID rules. Thompson’s daughter, Delinda Holland, told PolitiFact that her father filled out an application for a mail ballot in January. When she called Harris County to check on the status, she was told that it was rejected because he didn’t include his driver’s license number, she said. Thompson applied again, and his second application was rejected, too. She then contacted the Secretary of State’s office, where she was directed to have her father re-register. Harris County elections spokesperson Leah Shah told us that the earliest voter registration record they have for Thompson is from 1976, when the office computerized records.Featured Fact-checkFacebook posts stated on January 18, 2023 in a Facebook postDocument shows that Hunter Biden paid Joe Biden $50,000 a month in rent.By Samantha Putterman • January 19, 2023""He has lived at the same voting precinct the entire 95 years,"" Holland said.After being rejected for a mail ballot, Thompson updated his registration with ID information. Holland sent us a screengrab from the elections office mail ballot tracker showing that his mail ballot application was accepted Jan. 28 and that the ballot was being processed Jan. 29. The Secretary of State’s office has advised county officials and voters in similar situations to update their voter registration records, said Sam Taylor, a spokesperson for the secretary. As of Dec. 20, there were approximately 100,000 registered Texas voters that had neither identification number on their voter registration record out of more than 17.1 million registered voters, Taylor said.Thompson said he will vote in person if that’s his only optionHolland said it’s easier for her father to vote at home than go to the polls, but he will vote in person if that’s his only option. But they both expressed concern that other senior citizens in the same situation may not have a way to sort through the bureaucracy to ensure their ability to vote by mail.""I’ve been voting for many, many years, and I’ve never missed a vote,"" Thompson told an NBC-affiliated television station in Houston. ""I can get out and move around and go to a regular polling place, but there are lots of people that can’t.""Holland said her father, a World War II Army veteran, instilled in his children and grandchildren that they must vote. ""You vote, it’s not an option — it’s something you do,"" Holland said.Our rulingAbrams said, ""In Texas because of the laws they passed, a 95-year-old World War II veteran is being denied the right to vote by mail because he can't produce a registration number, he got back in the 1950s."" Thompson, the veteran, registered to vote in Houston decades ago when citizens didn’t have to provide ID.He applied for a mail ballot twice in January and received two denial letters. A new state law that requires the ID on a mail ballot application to match that on their registration record. Thompson ended up submitting updated ID information for his voter registration and it appears his application was accepted Jan. 28 and processed Jan. 29.Abrams made her statements after it had been reported that Thompson had re-registered.

129,Tom Kertscher,"Joe Biden's “$4 trillion” Build Back Better bill is ""the largest expansion of welfare programs in 60 years.""","To break out of the pack of GOP candidates running for an open U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania, Republican Carla Sands ran an ad attacking what she called President Joe Biden’s ""socialist"" Build Back Better legislation.Sands, who is former President Donald Trump's ambassador to Denmark, made a claim about welfare that we wanted to check.In the 30-second video, which is featured on her campaign website and which ran for a month on YouTube, Sands stands behind a table that holds a stack of paper and a shredding machine. ""This stack of paper is the 2,100 pages in Joe Biden’s $4 trillion spending bill,"" Sands states as she holds up a page entitled H.R. 5376. That is the bill number for Build Back Better. As she feeds the shredder, Sands makes several claims about the bill, the most specific being that it is ""the largest expansion of welfare programs in 60 years.""There are three issues we looked at in evaluating this claim: the size of the bill, how much it devotes to programs that might be considered welfare, and how that compares historically. We concluded that Sands gets a basic fact wrong, while her broader point about welfare spending isn’t clearly supported.First, Build Back Better would spend $1.75 trillion over 10 years, not $4 trillion. As for how much it devotes to welfare, that’s difficult to say, because there’s no clear definition of welfare. The bill would raise spending for social safety-net programs, including for low-income people, but it also includes $555 billion to fight climate change, nearly a third of the total.That complicates the third question, how it compares historically to other legislation.""There is no question that the package is among the most significant expansions of social welfare since the Great Society/War on Poverty programs in the 1960s,"" said Stephen Monroe Tomczak, a professor of social welfare policy at Southern Connecticut State University and president of the national Social Welfare History Group.""But whether it is, in fact, the largest is dependent on what elements of the initiative are considered ‘welfare programs.’  Some of the programs and policies proposed are commonly defined as such; others are not.""To back Sands’ claim, her campaign cited to PolitiFact a report about Build Back Better by the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank. The report uses the $4 trillion figure to back its conclusions, citing an ""illustrative scenario"" done by the Penn Wharton Budget Model at the University of Pennsylvania. But that estimate is based on all provisions in the bill remaining permanent, and it comes with a disclaimer that it is not an estimate of the Build Back Better legislation.Official cost is $1.75 trillion, not $4 trillionThe House approved a version of the Build Back Better Act in November. No action has been taken in the Senate, as Biden continues to press for support. This version of the bill would spend $1.75 trillion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. With an estimated $658 billion in expanded tax credits for individuals and businesses, the net revenue increase would be about $1 trillion, according to the Tax Foundation.Experts on the federal budget and social programs have criticized what they say are budget gimmicks that kept the price tag down to $1.75 trillion. For example, they note, the bill makes tax hikes permanent, but makes certain provisions such as a child tax credit, temporary.""It is well known that both the red team and the blue team game the CBO rules that guide how they estimate what particular pieces of legislation will cost,"" said economist Jeffrey Smith, associate director of the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Institute for Research on Poverty.Lawmakers could extend some of the temporary provisions in the future, increasing the price tag. But for now, all that’s certain is the $1.75 trillion. No clear definition of ‘welfare’Build Back Better would fund programs that provide financial assistance to people. How many of those programs amount to ""welfare"" is debatable, given that the word has different meanings for different people. Welfare can refer to federal programs providing food, health care, housing and financial assistance to low-income families. Some people use the term to refer to cash payouts to people who aren’t working, while others think it includes government assistance of any type. A more precise definition refers to federal programs with means testing — using a person’s means, such as income, to determine eligibility. Some Build Back Better provisions target lower-income people:Featured Fact-checkAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezstated on January 27, 2023 in an interview with reporters“The largest contributor to the debt ceiling, or to our deficit, has been the Trump tax cuts.”By Louis Jacobson • February 1, 2023$165 billion for what the White House called the biggest expansion of affordable health care in a decade. The provision reduces health care premiums under the Affordable Care Act and expands Medicare coverage to include hearing benefits.$150 billion for affordable housing and down payment and rental assistance, which the House Financial Services Committee called the largest such investment in U.S. history.$150 billion for a Medicaid program that provides affordable home health care, a provision that one Democratic senator called historic. Other provisions could benefit lower-income groups as well as those with greater means, and they may also include means tests: $400 billion would fund child care and preschool. Families that earn less than $300,000 annually would pay no more than 7% of their income on child care for kids under age 6.$200 billion would be used for child tax credits. Individuals with an income of up to $112,500 and couples with an income of up to $150,000 would be eligible.$200 billion would be for four weeks of paid family and medical leave.While major parts of the Build Back Better bill are for helping individuals, others are not. For example, the single-largest part of the $1.75 trillion — $555 billion — would fight climate change. Sands’ case for largest in 60 yearsSands’ claim that Build Back Better would be the largest expansion of welfare programs in 60 years likely refers to the Great Society, President Lyndon Johnson’s domestic agenda from the mid-1960s. That effort included not only a War on Poverty, but initiatives for environmental protection, immigration, education, highways and consumer protection, among other issues.We asked the Heritage Foundation’s Robert Rector, whose report Sands relies on, about Sands’ 60 years claim. He referred us to page 24 of his report. The report states that the bill would generate an additional $167 billion in means-tested spending in its first year, and that that ""would be by far the greatest increase in means-tested welfare spending in U.S. history.""The Heritage analysis defines welfare broadly, counting the refundable portion of the child credit; expansion of the earned income tax credit for low-income workers; the child care, pre-kindergarten and housing subsidies; and medical benefits for the Medicaid coverage gap, Rector told us.Rector said that in constant dollars, the $167 billion would be more than twice as large as any prior increase in means-tested welfare spending. The next-largest one-year increase was $83 billion in 2010 in constant 2019 dollars. Rector said the 2010 increase was mainly due to a rise in enrollments in existing programs because of the Great Recession, noting that key Obamacare provisions didn’t take effect until 2014.New means-tested spending over the first five years of Build Back Better would come to $836 billion, Rector said. In constant dollars, this would be larger than any five-year increase in such spending in U.S. history.  Rector said those figures are based on Build Back Better being $1.75 trillion.Another analysis, from the Washington Post, looks at the overall spending in Build Back Better as a share of the economy.It compared Biden’s original proposal — $3.5 trillion — to the New Deal and other major social spending programs since the 1930s.The Post found that the original Build Back Better spending would amount to 1.1% of annual gross domestic product. So taking into account that Build Back Better has been reduced to $1.75 trillion, the Post’s findings suggest that Build Back Better spending — including the climate change chunk — would amount to 0.55% of annual gross domestic product. That’s less than the Great Society’s 0.9% and less than the 1% spent by two Obama-era programs combined, the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, a stimulus bill.And on an annual basis, and relative to people’s incomes, Build Back Better is not as large as the 2020 CARES Act, which authorized $2.2 trillion in spending for just one year, said University of California, Davis, economics professor Peter Lindert, author of the 2021 book ""Making Social Spending Work.""That law, signed by Trump, included $1,200 direct payments to most Americans, enhanced unemployment aid, loans for small business and other relief measures.Our rulingSands said Biden's ""$4 trillion"" Build Back Better bill is ""the largest expansion of welfare programs in 60 years.""The legislation would spend $1.75 trillion, not $4 trillion, over 10 years.Experts said the legislation would be among the most significant expansions of social welfare programs since the 1960s, helping low-income as well as middle-income people. But definitions of what constitutes a welfare program vary, and there are a few different ways to make historical comparisons of legislation. The analysis cited by Sands is based on spending on programs that use means testing, and it shows the bill would be the largest such expansion. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

131,Paul Specht,"“From 1917 to 1994, half of the bills that were successfully filibustered in the Senate were civil rights legislation.”","A North Carolina congresswoman says a tool for blocking legislation in the Senate has been used a significant number of times against civil rights measures.Democratic Rep. Alma Adams tweeted on Jan. 11: ""From 1917 to 1994, half of the bills that were successfully filibustered in the Senate were Civil Rights legislation.""Democrats have had trouble advancing their agenda in the U.S. Senate. Now many of them are calling on senators to eliminate the filibuster, a procedure that effectively raises the bar for bill approval from a simple majority to 60 votes. Former President Barack Obama has referred to the filibuster as a ""Jim Crow relic"" and PolitiFact has written about how it was used to thwart civil rights legislation. We wondered if Adams was right about how frequently the filibuster was used against civil rights measures.Adams’ quote comes from one expert’s article in the Washington Post. However, tracking the use of the filibuster isn’t simple. While Adams’ stat is based on a credible analysis, some scholars take issue with it, saying that much depends on how one defines a filibuster and measures its success.What is the filibuster?The filibuster is a term that generally refers to a rule allowing a minority of senators to hold up legislation. Lawmakers can delay consideration of a bill by speaking on the Senate floor for hours at a time to state their opposition or to try to influence other senators. In some cases, the speeches go down as merely performative, having no influence on legislation.These days, senators don’t actually need to speak for hours on the floor to effectively use the filibuster. They can simply say they object to the legislation under consideration. Then, to end debate on the bill, the Senate must trigger what’s known as ""cloture,"" which requires 60 votes in favor of proceeding to a final vote. Republicans effectively used the tool last year to block Democrats’ voting rights legislation, known as the For The People Act. They also used it last week to defeat legislation that combined the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.There’s no official government tally for how many bills the filibuster has blocked. When it comes to civil rights, the U.S. Senate Historical Office says on its website:""Filibusters proved to be particularly useful to Southern senators who sought to block civil rights legislation, including anti-lynching bills. Not until 1964 did the Senate successfully overcome a filibuster to pass a major civil rights bill.""The historical office has not tried to count the total number of filibusters used, said Daniel S. Holt, an assistant historian in the historical office. That is partly ""because the definition of a filibuster and what constitutes a filibuster is a matter of interpretation,"" Holt said. Some bills have died under threat of filibuster, even if it wasn’t officially employed. Holt said scholars who have tried to count the total number of filibusters have used different criteria and come up with different counts over the years. What Adams citedWhen we reached Adams' office for comment, her spokesman cited an analysis published last year in The Washington Post. It was written by Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.Binder looked into how the filibuster was used against civil rights for a book she wrote with Steven Smith of Washington University in St. Louis titled, ""Politics or Principle? Filibustering in the U.S. Senate."" Binder said she and Smith used historical sources to try to generate the list of measures that were killed by filibuster despite having support from a majority of members in both the House and Senate, as well as the White House. ""Of the 30 measures we identified between 1917 and 1994, exactly half addressed civil rights — including measures to authorize federal investigation and prosecution of lynching, to ban the imposition of poll taxes and to prohibit discrimination on the basis of race in housing sales and rentals,"" she wrote for The Post.Featured Fact-checkTweetsstated on January 24, 2023 in a tweetDiamond and Silk pundit died from COVID-19By Paul Specht • February 6, 2023Binder acknowledged that other scholars have reached different conclusions. ""Ultimately, all these counts need an asterisk to make sure that readers understand the difficulty of recreating a comprehensive historical record,"" she said in an email to PolitiFact NC.Eric Schickler, a political science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, thinks Binder’s sentiment is generally accurate. Schickler co-authored the book, ""Filibuster: Obstruction and Lawmaking in the U.S. Senate.""""If you just say, ‘What were the measures that likely had the majority in favor of it, that were defeated because of minority instruction?’ I think it's right to say that about half of them, in that period, were civil rights-related bills,"" Schickler said.If Binder’s count of bills defeated by the filibuster seems low, Schickler notes that it was unusual for the tool to be used to permanently kill a bill until the 1970s. The exception was civil rights, he said.""The senators who were opposed to [a particular civil rights measure] tended to be much more committed than the senators in favor of it,"" he said. ""So in other words, the Southern senators who opposed civil rights in, let’s say ’20s, ’30s, ’40s and ’50s, they were willing to pull out all the stops and use obstruction to the kill."" Other opinionThere’s not a consensus on Binder’s count.The percentage of filibusters that affected civil rights is probably lower than half, says Gregory Koger, chair of the University of Miami’s political science department. Koger wrote, ""Filibustering: A Political History of Obstruction in the House and Senate.""Koger said it may be easier to track the fate of civil rights bills because, between the 1930s and 1960s, senators were more likely to call for cloture votes on them than on other filibustered legislation. ""This enabled them to create a public record of their position for the press and interest groups, knowing that the votes would fail,"" he told PolitiFact NC in an email.Koger says his thorough and ""systematic"" approach to finding defeated bills ""identified many more instances of non-civil rights filibusters, so the overall proportion was much less than one-half.""Gregory Wawro co-authored ""Filibuster: Obstruction and Lawmaking in the U.S. Senate"" with Schickler and has a slightly different opinion. ""My sense is that (Binder’s) number is probably too high, but I don't know that we should get too hung up on that,"" said Wawro, chair of the political science department at Columbia University.""The general point that (Binder and Smith) are making still holds: the class of bills most successfully targeted during this period were civil rights bills. I don't think whether it was half or less than half really matters that much,"" Wawro said.Our rulingAdams said: ""From 1917 to 1994, half of the bills that were successfully filibustered in the Senate were civil rights legislation."" Her claim is supported by an analysis by a political scientist who has co-authored a book on the history of the filibuster. However, some scholars aren’t in agreement on this issue.At least two other experts say civil rights bills probably accounted for less than half of bills successfully filibustered during the highlighted time period.The statement is partially accurate: some experts do support Adams' claim.

132,Warren Fiske,Virginia’s “education standards for math and reading are now the lowest in the nation.”,"In his maiden speech to the General Assembly, Gov. Glenn Youngkin reaffirmed his campaign vow to stiffen academic standards in public schools.""Virginia schools have a lofty reputation but lately we’ve not lived up to that reputation,"" Youngkin, a Republican, said in a Jan. 17 address. ""In fact, our educational standards for math and reading are now the lowest in the nation.""We fact-checked Youngkin’s last-in-the nation claim during the campaign and think it bears repeating now that he’s in office. Federal research does show Virginia has the lowest baselines for student proficiency on its standardized tests of all measured states for fourth-grade math and reading and eighth-grade reading. This comparison only measures the rigor of various state standards, however, not how well students are learning.When it comes to performance on standardized national exams, Virginia’s fourth graders rank near the top and its eighth graders rank high in math and at the national average in reading. Youngkin does not offer this important perspective.   Youngkin’s bottom-of-the-barrel claim is based on a 2021 report by the National Center for Education Statistics, a branch of the U.S. Department of Education. The center examined the proficiency standards in each state in 2019 and assigned them ""equivalent scores"" on a 0-to-500 scale. Higher scores mean higher standards.""The study is intended to help readers understand the myriad state assessment results that are otherwise difficult to compare and to serve a policy need for reliable information that compares state standards,"" the report says. ""The study is not an evaluation of the various state assessments or of the quality of the states’ achievement standards, and the findings should not be interpreted as evidence of deficiencies in state assessments…""In other words, the study is not judging whether state proficiency standards on tests  should be high, low or in the middle. It’s just offering data.The report focuses on reading and math tests in fourth and eighth grades.The equivalent score compares the percentage of students who are deemed proficient on state tests to the percentage that reach the proficiency standard on national tests.Virginia’s exams are called Standards of Learning tests, or SOLs, and are taken by all fourth and eighth graders, as well as some other grades. The national exam is taken by a representative sample of fourth and eight graders in each state. It’s called National Assessment of Education Progress but is better known as the ""Nation’s Report Card.""Virginia’s numbers In fourth grade reading, Virginia’s proficiency standards were the lowest among 49 states (excluding New Hampshire). The equivalent score was 200. The median score among states was 224. Tennessee had the highest score at 238.In fourth grade math, Virginia standards were again the lowest among 49 states. The equivalent score was 219. The median was 242. Colorado had the highest score at 257.In eighth grade reading, Virginia’s proficiency standards were lowest among 46 states measured. The equivalent score was 236. The median was 266. Kansas was highest, at 288.Featured Fact-checkLouise Lucasstated on January 18, 2023 in a tweet.Glenn Youngkin is “the first sitting Governor in the modern era to have their party have less legislative seats than when they were elected.”By Warren Fiske • January 31, 2023Virginia’s standards for eighth grade math were not measured, nor were those of 14 other states. The reason — according to Charles Pyle, director of media relations for the Virginia Department of Education — is that eighth graders take different math classes based on their abilities, so there is not a single standardized math exam for everyone.Experts stress that equivalent scores do not evaluate how well students are learning.""What Virginia considers proficient may not be at the same level of what other states consider proficient,"" Grady Wilburn, a statistician for the National Center for Education Statistics, told us last fall. ""It doesn’t mean that the students know less than students in other states.""Indeed, Virginia fourth graders in 2019 had the third-highest math score on the national test and the ninth-highest reading score.Virginia eighth graders ranked seventh in math and 30th in reading.Youngkin says Virginia’s public schools have strayed from basic instruction under the last two Democratic governors, Ralph Northam and Terry McAuliffe, who led the state from 2014 to 2022. Youngkin says the state’s standardized tests should require students to attain high, aspirational learning levels.Virginia’s proficiency standards for reading were set in 2013 by a state school board appointed by Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell. The math standards were set in 2019 by a state school board appointed by McAuliffe and Northam. McAuliffe deemphasized standardized testing when he was governor from 2014 to 2018, a move that was cheered by many local school boards and gained bipartisan support in the General Assembly.Dan Gecker, president of the state school board, said Virginia’s proficiency standards are set with a practical goal rather than an aspirational one. ""We’re looking to set the cut level at a specific body of knowledge for a child to succeed at the next grade level,"" he said.Our rulingYoungkin said Virginia’s ""education standards for math and reading are now the lowest in the nation.""He is referring to a federal study that shows Virginia in 2019 had the lowest baselines for proficiency on its standardized tests for fourth grade math and reading and eighth grade reading. The National Center for Education Statistics does not compare test standards for other grades.Youngkin’s statement, however, skips important context. The NCES stresses that its equivalency ratings on standardized tests in states do not reflect how well students are learning in each state. Youngkin omits that Virginia students score near the top on standardized national tests for fourth grade math and reading and eight grade math. Eighth grade leading levels are at the national average.Youngkin’s claim, without elaboration, wrongly suggests that Virginia students are being taught less than their colleagues across the county.So we rate his statement Half True.",Glenn Youngkin,"January 21, 2022",half-true

In Texas and Tennessee, for example, gun permits are considered valid voter IDs, but student IDs are not. Critics say this makes it easy for gun owners, a heavily Republican group, to vote but harder for students, a predominantly Democratic group.

""When I left in 2008, it was at its lowest.""We fact-checked Wilder's claim and found it partially correct. Wilder did not inherit the highest crime rate in Richmond history when he became mayor on Jan. 2, 2005. The city’s overall crime rate was significantly higher in the 1990s, as were the rates for violent crime and murder. They had been on a slow decline for at least 10 years when Wilder became mayor, according to FBI data.But Wilder is right that when he stepped down as mayor on the first day of 2009, the city’s crime rate was at a low point - at least since 1995, which is the earliest comprehensive data we found. So were the rates for violent crime and murder.Wilder acknowledged to us that he misspoke about inheriting Richmond’s highest crime rate and offered clarification. ""The crime rate was increasing when I became mayor and decreasing when I left,"" he said. Again, he’s partially right. For history’s sake, let’s take a deeper look.Wilder’s recordU.S. crime rates soared in the early 1990s and many experts largely blamed it on the crack cocaine epidemic.   Richmond’s overall crime rate in 1995 (again, the earliest record we could find) was 103 offenses per 1,000 residents, according to our computations from FBI data. That is the highwater mark moving forward. The rate, with a couple of blips, dropped over the next nine years and stood at 80 crimes per 1,000 residents in 2004, the year before Wilder became mayor. It continued to fall throughout Wilder’s term and in 2008, his last full year, the rate was 48 crimes per 1,000.  In 2019, the last year FBI records are available, Richmond’s rate was 40 crimes per 1,000 residents.The violent crime rate was 27 per 1,000 residents in 2004 and dropped to 16 per 1,000 in 2008. In 2019, the rate fell to 11.Featured Fact-checkLouise Lucasstated on January 18, 2023 in a tweet.Glenn Youngkin is “the first sitting Governor in the modern era to have their party have less legislative seats than when they were elected.”By Warren Fiske • January 31, 2023Richmond’s murder rate was .47 per 1,000 when Wilder became mayor and .16 when he left - a low mark since 1995 that still stands. The number of murders fell from 93 in 2004 to 31 in 2008.Crime rates fell in many U.S. cities during Wilder’s tenure as Richmond’s mayor. Richmond’s drop was steeper than each of three cities we researched: New York, Detroit and Los Angeles.A December 2008 article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch attributed Richmond’s lowered rates to community-based policing strategies employed by then-Police Chief Rodney Monroe, a ""drastic increase in police manpower,"" and prosecutors seeking tougher sentences in court. The Richmond Police Department reported 98 murders in 2021, the most in 24 years, and Wilder says Richmond should recommit to his strategies. ""It goes beyond murder,"" he told us. ""It goes to actual shootings. Not a day goes by that you don’t read about someone getting shot.""""It takes a village to fight crime,"" Wilder told us.A review of recent research on how policing affects crime rates, conducted by the Richmond branch of the Federal Reserve last year, found that increases in police presence have been shown to drive down crime. However, the conclusion of the article contained a caveat.""Crime is an outcome of multiple factors. Education, employment opportunities, poverty, access to housing and health services, food deserts, and many other factors play important and complementary roles in determining crime levels."" The study said ""a holistic and comprehensive approach to address the problem of crime prevention seems to be the most reasonable course of action."" The murder surge reflects a national trend. The U.S. saw a 29% increase in homicides in 2020, the largest rise since the start of national record keeping began in 1960. Preliminary figures suggest murders may have increased by another 10% in 2021.Experts largely attribute the surge to isolation and economic distress caused by COVID-19 as well as conflicts stemming from social media use.Our rulingWilder said, ""When I became mayor of the City of Richmond in 2004, the crime rate was at its highest. When I left in 2008, it was at its lowest.""Wilder did not inherit a record high crime rate when he became mayor in January 2005. The rate was much higher in the 1990s and had been ebbing.When Wilder left office at the start of 2009, Richmond’s overall crime rate was at its lowest level since 1995, which is the farthest back we could find records.We rate Wilder’s statement Half True.",Doug Wilder,"January 10, 2022",half-true
137,Paul Specht,"“Corporate profit margins are at their highest point in 70 years. … They’re overcharging us for gas, medicine, and groceries, and pocketing the difference.”","A Democratic congressional candidate in North Carolina says corporations are making more money than they have in seven decades. Former state Rep. Erica Smith is campaigning to represent North Carolina’s newly-drawn 2nd Congressional District. On Dec. 30, she tweeted:""Corporate profit margins are at their highest point in 70 years. Corporations are trying to blame inflation on stimulus checks. Meanwhile, they’re overcharging us for gas, medicine, and groceries, and pocketing the difference. It’s a racket.""PolitiFact has written multiple fact checks on inflation, wages and whether the cost of goods is related to presidential policy. Smith’s comments address a different angle of high prices, and we wondered whether she was right.It turns out that, after taxes, corporate profits did hit a 70-year high last year, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, citing U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data. But economists say Smith’s tweet gives a misleading impression about the prices of gas, groceries and medicine.Corporate profitsThe prices of various goods have climbed as demand has increased for limited supply. Despite that, companies have been able to keep profit margins high by cutting costs and passing higher costs along to consumers, Reuters reported in September.Government numbers, which aren’t adjusted for inflation, were updated on Dec. 22. They show that corporate profits in the quarter ending Sept. 30 tallied $2.7 trillion dollars, the highest level since 1950. Corporate profits in the previous quarter also reached a high as a percentage of gross domestic product.Smith’s campaign cited a Bloomberg News article about the profits, titled: ""Fattest Profits Since 1950 Debunk Wage-Inflation Story of CEOs."" The ""pocketing the difference"" line in Smith’s tweet comes from President Biden, who called out gasoline companies that kept prices high at the pump even as wholesale gas prices started to decline.Bloomberg created a chart showing the gap between wholesale gasoline and the price at the pump, on a rolling five-day average. Bloomberg’s data showed the gap rising from $1.18 per gallon in early August to $1.42 in late November.Yardeni Research, a consulting firm offering financial analysis, in December produced a report on the profit margins of S&P 500 companies. The report shows corporate profit margins at their highest levels since at least 1994.Smith is certainly not the first Democrat to point the finger at corporations during the pandemic. Economists who spoke to PolitiFact NC said the first line of Smith’s tweet is generally accurate. However, some said her comments about companies ""overcharging us for gas, medicine, and groceries"" need additional context.The price of gas, groceries and medicineEconomists recently told the New York Times that it doesn’t make sense to blame businesses for profit-seeking in recent months, considering that supply is low, demand is high, and the government recently put more money in Americans’ pockets.Featured Fact-checkTweetsstated on January 24, 2023 in a tweetDiamond and Silk pundit died from COVID-19By Paul Specht • February 6, 2023""I do not necessarily agree with the claim that the current record level of the profit margin shows that businesses are ‘overcharging us for gas, medicine, and groceries, and pocketing the difference,’"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution.Burtless said the Yardeni report shows that ""the current high rate of profitability may be offsetting sharply lower profit rates the same companies experienced in the months in 2020, when the pandemic dramatically reduced the profitability of many companies’ operations.""Exxon Mobil Corp. Last year, Exxon Mobil Corp., for instance, reported a third-quarter profit margin of 9.4%. That figure is the company’s highest since 2017. Meanwhile, gas prices, which plunged in March and April 2020 as the pandemic took hold and fewer people commuted to work, are on average about 67 cents per gallon higher now than they were in January 2020. But prices are lower than they were in portions of 2012, 2013 and 2014, according to GasBuddy, a company that tracks U.S. gas prices. When it comes to medicine, consumers in America do tend to pay more for prescriptions than those in other countries. Researchers at the University of Southern California and at Brookings found that U.S. consumers account for about 64% to 78% of total pharmaceutical profits. While the prices of some prescription drugs are regulated, AARP in June released a report that said retail prices for 260 widely-used prescription drugs increased in 2020 by an average 2.9%, more than twice the general rate of inflation.As for groceries, economists balked at the notion that local grocers are shaking down customers. ""Profit margins vary dramatically not only by industry, but by company,"" said Scott Lincicome, a senior fellow in economic studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. Historically, grocery stories and gas stations have ""notoriously low profit margins,"" he said in a phone interview.Kroger, one of the largest grocery store chains in the U.S., reported a third-quarter profit margin of 1.5%, down compared to the same period in 2019. The third-quarter figure isn’t historically high.The cause of rising grocery prices is more a tale of supply and demand than of corporate greed, said Lincicome and Dean Baker, an economist and co-founder of the Center for Economic Policy and Research.""The high prices are a pretty simple story that there is a big jump in demand and no corresponding increase in supply,"" Baker told PolitiFact in an email. ""I don't see any special conspiracy story there,"" he said. ""I expect prices to moderate as demand falls back to some extent and supply increases.""Our rulingSmith said ""Corporate profit margins are at their highest point in 70 years … they're overcharging us for gas, medicine, and groceries, and pocketing the difference.""Government data show that Smith is right about the profit margins of companies in the U.S., collectively speaking.Consumers in the U.S. tend to pay more for medicine than consumers in other countries. Oil companies are also making more money lately.

Adjusted for inflation, that's $530.27/wk, $27,574/yr, or $13.50/hr. ""Most Americans on minimum wage earn less than a Dickensian allegory for destitution.""This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)The Facebook post by The Other 98% now includes a label that it is ""missing context"" and the caption notes that the post has been fact-checked by Lead Stories, which wrote that there was no evidence to support the claim. The author of the original tweet later admitted his claim was ""based on super-sloppy googling.""The federal minimum wage in the U.S. is $7.25 an hour and has not been raised since 2009. However, 30 states, plus three territories, have minimum wages higher than the federal level, the highest being $15.20 in the District of Columbia. Many cities or counties also have minimum wages higher than the federal or state levels, including a high of $17.13 in Emeryville, Calif., and many employers are surpassing the required minimum as they face difficulty filling jobs during the pandemic, CNBC reported.We spoke with several experts about the poster’s claim, and the consensus is there is really no perfect way to make such a comparison. ""There are various ways to calculate what 15 shillings in 1840 would be in English pounds today, and they don’t give the same answer,"" said George Boyer, the senior associate dean for academic affairs and professor of economics, and international and comparative labor at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations""Moreover, you then need to convert to U.S. currency, and the value of the dollar in terms of British pounds is far different from what it was in 1840. So 10 different people doing the calculation would get 10 different answers,"" he said.Vincent Geloso, an assistant professor of economics at George Mason University who specializes in the measurement of living standards now and in the past, said the post appears wrong on a ""great many levels,"" first of which is the ""numbers are just off.""But are the numbers even relevant? Cratchit is not exactly the ""allegory for destitution"" the post claims. He was a skilled worker that would have made much more than many workers in the Victorian era, they said.Geloso said the comparison is ""meaningless,"" arguing that Cratchit was paid well above the median Briton and that his annual income of 39 pounds was only a bit less than the U.K. average of 57 pounds in 1846. Featured Fact-checkBloggersstated on January 15, 2023 in a blog postThe World Economic Forum hired “unvaccinated pilots” to fly people into Davos, Switzerland, for its annual meeting for safety reasons.By Ciara O'Rourke • January 18, 2023He said that a ""well-known measure called welfare ratios, which estimate earnings divided by the cost of a basket of subsistence goods,"" show that Cratchit could buy more than six times that basket, far more than the poorest workers.""Cratchit was thus well above the poverty line,"" Geloso wrote.Boyer also said the comparison in the post is off base.""The key thing for Thompson and others to remember is that Cratchit’s occupation was clerk.  He was NOT one of the working poor. Saying that Cratchit’s wage was above today’s minimum wage is not a relevant calculation. He could have been a badly paid clerk and still made more than a member of the lower working class,"" Boyer said, adding that comparing the wages of day laborers in that era may have made a better choice.Gregory Clark, an economics professor at the University of California, Davis, argued that Cratchit would be worse off than today’s minimum wage worker, saying, ""The tweet overestimates the hourly wage in 1843 in terms of purchasing power by about eightfold.""Clark said Cratchit, as a relatively skilled worker in a time when 40% of men were illiterate, would have been well paid for that time, though he lived in a high-cost city. But, he said, his wages, based on a 60-hour work week, amount to a meager purchasing power of only $1.70 per hour in today’s U.S. dollars. Samuel Williamson, co-founder and president of the economic data site MeasuringWorth and professor emeritus of economics at Miami University in Ohio, pointed us to two blog posts he wrote about Cratchit’s salary and what it would be worth today.In one, he writes that Cratchit was poorly paid for the job he had, but would have had a salary with a relative earnings value of $43,000 in U.S. dollars in 2020, or $21.44 per hour, based on a 40-hour work week, far more than the $13.50 cited in the tweet.In the other, he also calculated the same figure as Clark on the real wage value of 15 shillings, but said that value is ""computed using a retail consumer price index of a basket of goods and services"" and is ""unrealistic"" because ""the market baskets purchased by representative consumers have changed so much.""He said that the relative earnings value is a better comparison and wrote in another essay that most measures of worth are better than using the CPI.Experts we spoke with agree that the average work week in the Victorian era would be more than 40 hours, probably at least 60. Dividing Williamson’s $43,000 figure by 60 hours gets you to the original poster’s $13.50 figure.But the post seems to ignore the gains made by workers, said James Kincaid, a professor emeritus of English at the University of Southern California and editor of ""The Daily Charles Dickens: A Year in Quotes.""""It seems to suggest that all the efforts of organized labor have done nothing more than maintain the status quo, and that's nonsense,"" said Kincaid, who said the average worker in that era worked 66 to 75 hours per week.Kincaid said there is no good way to determine what 15 shillings then would amount to in U.S. wages today. He added that ""Dickens knew what a barely-above-starvation wage would be for a worker like Cratchit with his family would be, as did his readers.""Our rulingA Facebook post based on a tweet said that a Charles Dickens ""allegory for destitution"" made more than most American workers today do on a minimum wage salary.Cratchit’s earnings outperformed U.S. minimum-wage earners, but his experience was not a portrayal of a low-wage worker. Cratchit was making far more than the average worker in London during the Victorian era, experts say. The comparison between 1840s shillings and today’s dollars is problematic. One expert said Cratchit would be making $21.44 per hour in today’s dollars, assuming a 40-hour week.We rate this claim Half True.CORRECTION: We updated this fact-check on Jan. 4 to correct the name of Cornell professor George Boyer.",Facebook posts,"January 3, 2022",half-true
139,Madeline Heim,"The push for high-speed internet for rural areas, from the start, “was a Democratic thing.”","The need for more Americans to have better high-speed internet access is a common refrain these days — and it’s a rare one that reaches across the aisle. Republicans and Democrats alike — from the nation’s executive branch down to municipal officials — have taken swings at expanding access. President George W. Bush called for all Americans to have high-speed internet by 2007. In 2010, President Barack Obama released a report with more than 200 recommendations to improve broadband. In 2019, President Donald Trump unveiled the $20 billion Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, and in recent months President Joe Biden earmarked tens of billions of dollars for broadband expansion as part of his infrastructure bill. In Wisconsin, where about a quarter of rural residents live without access to high-speed internet, the 2021-23 budget signed by Gov. Tony Evers set aside $129 million to grow a grant program that funds efforts to improve broadband services in regions that need them. The final budget ultimately was authored by GOP legislators, who backed the provision.(Evers had called for spending nearly $200 million on high-speed internet access in his proposed budget, which legislators discarded for other reasons.)In a Dec. 12, 2021 interview for Madison TV station WKOW’s Capital City Sunday program, state Sen. Jon Erpenbach, D-West Point, talked about how his party needs to do a better job reaching out to rural voters — and cited broadband as an example of issues where rural residents are not aware of Democratic efforts.Democrats, he said, have been pushing for more high-speed internet access for years: ""No matter where you live, that you should have access to high-speed internet — that was a Democratic thing."" Is he right? In Wisconsin, did Democrats lead the charge to improve rural broadband? Republican, Democrat approaches to improving rural broadband differ When asked for backup for the claim, Erpenbach spokesperson Kelly Becker pointed to a bill introduced in 2001 by Democrats, including former state Rep. Jennifer Shilling, who later served in the state Senate and left her seat in 2020, and former Sen. Richard Grobschmidt, who died in 2016. The bill would have required the now-dissolved state Department of Commerce to develop a map and database of broadband internet service providers in Wisconsin. It failed to pass during that session. Becker argued Wisconsin Republicans did not act on broadband until 2003, when they proposed exempting broadband internet service from regulation by the Public Service Commission and local governments. Barry Orton, professor emeritus of telecommunications at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the Republican position on broadband has historically been to deregulate the industry and allow the marketplace to decide who gets what services. This, he said, ""has always left unprofitable rural markets with poor or no service."" Democrats, meanwhile, have sought to fund broadband expansion for years, at least since the beginning of the Obama administration, Orton said. Former Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle in 2010 announced the state would spend nearly $23 million in federal stimulus funds from Obama’s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to improve broadband access across the state’s 72 counties. Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 5, 2023 in a Facebook postMark Zuckerberg launched a platform last month ""that allows each user to earn from $500 a day without even leaving home.""By Ciara O'Rourke • February 8, 2023A year later, when Wisconsin had flipped Republican under former Gov. Scott Walker, state officials returned those stimulus funds to the federal government, saying there were too many strings attached. Becker also pointed to a 2015 motion Erpenbach made as a member of the state’s Joint Finance Committee to make changes to the broadband expansion grants program, including expanding eligibility for the grants and creating a biennial general purpose revenue appropriation for making the grants. The motion failed 12-4 on a party line vote. State Republicans, however, say their early focus on eliminating the sales tax on internet services predates Democrats’ push for broadband expansion. A spokesperson for state Rep. Rob Summerfield, R-Bloomer — who along with state Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, has called for better broadband infrastructure in Wisconsin — pointed to a 1999 bill aiming for a sales and use tax exemption for providing access to, or use of, the internet. The bill was introduced in part by then-Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen, a Republican who represented Waukesha, said Alex Braaten, a research assistant for Summerfield. Jensen had previously advocated for reducing or eliminating that sales tax, in part because he believed it would limit growth of the internet economy and slow development of e-commerce, according to a 1999 Milwaukee Business Journal article. Braaten argued that, in doing so, Jensen sought to make the internet more affordable for Wisconsinites and ease the tax burden on small service providers so they could expand. (In 2016, Congress passed legislation banning state and local governments from taxing access to the internet. Wisconsin, one of just a handful of states that still did so, was forced to phase out the tax beginning in summer 2020.) At the local level, need for broadband isn’t about politics It’s worth noting that experts say party doesn’t matter much when it comes to the need for high-speed internet within local communities. Doug Dawson, a nationally recognized internet consultant from North Carolina, told PolitiFact Wisconsin he couldn’t think of one example of political bias from the approximately 500 communities he’s worked with to improve broadband access. ""There are almost no rural politicians opposed to getting better broadband — and most are active proponents,"" he wrote. ""I assume most such politicians are Republicans."" Where the partisan divide begins to rear its head, he said, is the question of how to fund better broadband — ""and funding anything quickly becomes partisan."" Our rulingErpenbach claimed pushing for better high-speed internet access was ""a Democratic thing."" Democrats pushed a broad variety of potential solutions and called for funding early, but Republicans did float bills that could address parts of the problem, albeit market-driven approaches that experts say would leave places that are most expensive to reach uncovered. Today, both sides agree on the need for better broadband — just not quite how to get there. And at the local level, experts say advocating for improved internet access is a grassroots effort, not a political one. We rate his claim Half True.  window.gciAnalyticsUAID = 'PMJS-TEALIUM-COBRAND';window.gciAnalyticsLoadEvents = false;window.gciAnalytics.view({    'event-type': 'pageview',    'content-type': 'interactives',    'content-ssts-section': 'news',    'content-ssts-subsection': 'news:politics',    'content-ssts-topic': 'news:politics:politifactwisconsin',    'content-ssts-subtopic': ' news:politics:politifactwisconsin'});",Jon Erpenbach,"December 28, 2021",half-true

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez crying after “Ted Cruz gets up and humiliates her to her face.”By Ciara O'Rourke • January 26, 2023Grassley had joined Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, Ernst and 19 other senators on Dec. 8 in support of an amendment that would have eliminated the last portion from the legislation. That portion – Section 8 –  contained the language giving the Senate authority to expedite through Dec. 31 a vote on raising the debt limit a non-specified amount by using a joint resolution, which would allow a simple majority vote instead of a 60-vote majority to pass. The amendment failed.""Had the bill not included the debt ceiling provision, Sen. Grassley would have supported it,"" Grassley’s communications director Taylor Foy wrote in an email to PolitiFact Iowa.Foy sent a list of 16 legislative bills Grassley supports that provide Medicare access and health care benefits. Grassley sponsored some of them, including the Rural Health Clinic Protection Act that was part of legislation signed into law in April that also spared Medicare for nine months of automatic 2% spending cuts. The latest action stops cuts for three months. Medicare was headed for a 2% sequestration cut on Jan. 1 and a mid-January 4% cut in Medicare provider payments. ""Sen. Grassley supports the 60 vote threshold to reach finality on legislation, which forces bipartisanship and collaboration on proposals being considered during the normal course of action in the Senate,"" Foy wrote. ""But, that wasn’t his chief concern regarding the process in this particular instance. His procedural concern here is that a supposed ‘one-time’ change of the Senate rules (whether related to vote thresholds or not) rarely results in a one-off event, and tactics to sidestep the Senate’s standing rules are often repeated once the precedent is set.""Christian Slater, Finkenauer’s campaign communications director, countered in a PolitiFact Iowa interview that Finkenauer was on solid ground and not lying about Grassley’s vote. The legislation before the Senate specifically protected Medicare funding from being cut, and Grassley voted against it, he said.""It doesn’t matter what you theoretically support — you voted to cut Medicare,"" Slater said.Slater had a list, too, of votes Grassley took in 2012 and 2013 on proposals by then U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, to cut federal spending. The 2012 budget proposal, which failed 41 to 58, capped Medicare beneficiary payments for people under the age of 55 at 2012 levels, with annual, inflationary adjustments. Democrats said then that Republicans voted to end Medicare, earning PolitiFact’s 2011 Lie of the Year designation, although PolitiFact noted that Democrats’ assertion that the Republican plan would privatize Medicare was Mostly True.Slater cited that privatization attempt as a bid to cut Medicare funding. He cited Grassley votes to revisit the Ryan budget proposal in 2012 and also a 2013 Grassley vote on an involved budget amendment to bring down proposed fiscal 2014 spending, revise spending levels for fiscal 2013 and set federal budget levels through 2023. That budget amendment was tied to a Ryan budget proposal to rein in the federal spending growth rate and included a Medicare policy that would have given seniors the option of using subsidies to buy private health insurance. The moves failed in the Democrat-controlled Senate.This time around, Grassley voted against legislation that, had his side prevailed, would have resulted in automatic cuts to Medicare funding unless further action were taken.Why? Because of budget sequestration, the method by which federal funding is cut automatically under the Budget Control Act of 2011 that allows spending caps if spending exceeds congressional appropriations.Words matterZona countered by referring to the 2021 Medicare and debt ceiling legislation’s words. For Finkenauer’s assertion to be true, Zona said, the legislation would have had to state specifically that Medicare was being slashed. It does not use those words, he said.""There was never a vote to cut Medicare funding, or to slash it,"" Zona, who is out of government now and spokesman and senior vice president at a public affairs company, Bullpen Strategy, told PolitiFact Iowa in an interview. He followed up in an email, writing that Grassley delivered as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee expanded Medicare benefits to ""tens of millions of Americans.""Our rulingFinkenauer said Grassley’s vote against the combined Medicare extension and debt ceiling meant voting to slash Medicare. Is Finkenauer lying, as Zona tweeted?She is correct about Grassley declining to vote in this instance to stave off a pending Medicare funding cut and, for that matter, about wanting to preserve the Senate’s 60-vote rule. But the legislation did not specifically call for slashing Medicare funding — if a 2% cut fits the definition of slashing — or close the door on finding another way to avoid cutting Medicare funding.The exchange between Finkenauer and Grassley is just the latest example of the two parties forcing their opponents to vote on combinations of measures that force them to choose between voting for something they don’t like, or voting against something they do. If they pursue the latter course, it can be weaponized into campaign attacks. Both parties do this regularly.Figuring out how Congress works through various pieces of legislation and how debate is carried out in a political dispute like this benefits from having context.

142,Laura Schulte,"Says Joe Biden “shut down travel from 8 countries in response to the Omicron variant, but he refuses to require a #COVID19 test for illegal immigrants crossing our Southern border.”","The discovery of a new variant of COVID-19 -- dubbed Omicron -- has once again set the world on edge, with leaders scrambling to keep people safe amid questions about just how dangerous the new strain is.In the U.S., President Joe Biden responded by limiting travel from some affected countries, but that only prompted criticism about what the U.S. is not doing at the southern border.On Nov. 30, 2021, U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wisconsin, tweeted this about Biden: ""POTUS shut down travel from 8 countries in response to the Omicron variant, but he refuses to require a #COVID19 test for illegal immigrants crossing our Southern border."" For the purpose of this fact-check, we’re going to look into both parts of Grothman’s claim -- Did Biden put restrictions on eight countries? And are the migrants coming into the U.S. via the southern border not being tested for COVID? Is Grothman correct? Generally speaking, yes. But there is considerable information missing. Biden blocks travel from eight African countries following discovery of OmicronLet’s start with the first part of the claim. Did Biden block travel from eight countries upon the discovery of the Omicron variant? According to a Nov. 26, 2021 proclamation, travelers from eight African countries were indeed blocked from entry into the U.S. to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Those countries were  Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe. The travel restrictions do not apply to U.S. citizens, however. In his proclamation, Biden says the travel advisory is necessary to protect the U.S., because African countries had not yet been able to conduct genomic sequencing on the variant to detect how much more transmissible it may be.So that part of the claim is on point.But what about the other part? Report found that most migrants not tested for COVID after crossing bordersGrothman said in a Dec. 3, 2021 interview that he learned the U.S Border Patrol wasn’t testing all immigrants entering the U.S. during a visit this year to a facility in Yuma, Arizona. He said he was told by agents that if a person declined a test, the agents weren’t able to press the issue any further. Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on January 17, 2023 in an Instagram postCNN reported that Damar Hamlin’s doctor confirmed his cardiac arrest was caused by a COVID-19 vaccine booster.By Ciara O'Rourke • January 19, 2023When asked about the statement, Grothman’s office also sent over a list of other sources that noted that testing for COVID hasn’t been required at the border. One was a Sept. 10, 2021 memo from the Office of the Inspector General in the Department of Health Services, which said an inspection found that U.S. Customs and Border Control was not testing migrants, and was not required to do so, relying instead on local public health systems to test symptomatic individuals. The memo also noted that the DHS does not have the authority to enforce testing procedures at the border, either. Grothman’s office also shared a link to an April 28, 2021 New York Times report that included similar information: U.S. authorities were failing to test migrants crossing into the U.S. via the southern border, creating situations ripe for new transmission of the virus. The Times report said officials cited insufficient time and space to conduct more widespread testing – but it is from nearly nine months ago. Meanwhile, in a more recent fact-check, from August 2021, PolitiFact National noted:""COVID-19 testing protocols have existed at the border under both the present and former administrations. Testing is done via a patchwork of federal agencies, local governments, organizations and contractors at various stages of the immigration process. ""In April, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security told PolitiFact that it works with state authorities, local authorities and non-governmental organizations to ensure that ‘100% of noncitizens’ are tested for COVID-19 ‘at some point during their immigration journey.’ The agency also has told PolitiFact that a negative coronavirus test is required by the federal government before entry to the U.S.""So, the picture on testing at the border is a difficult one to get a firm handle on. Even the most recent item cited by Grothman – the OIG memo on DHS and other agencies – noted that in many cases local governments are being relied upon for testing. Our ruling Grothman claimed that Biden halted travel from eight countries due to the discovery of the Omicron variant, but was still allowing migrants crossing the Southern border to go untested. Biden did halt travel from eight African countries following the discovery of the variant there, in hopes of slowing the spread into the U.S. Meanwhile, at the southern border reports have shown there is no widespread testing by federal agencies there. Instead, to the degree testing is occurring, local governments are being relied upon to do it. So Grothman is a bit off the mark there.Our definition of Half True is a ""statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.""That fits here. window.gciAnalyticsUAID = 'PMJS-TEALIUM-COBRAND';window.gciAnalyticsLoadEvents = false;window.gciAnalytics.view({    'event-type': 'pageview',    'content-type': 'interactives',    'content-ssts-section': 'news',    'content-ssts-subsection': 'news:politics',    'content-ssts-topic': 'news:politics:politifactwisconsin',    'content-ssts-subtopic': ' news:politics:politifactwisconsin'});",Glenn Grothman,"December 14, 2021",half-true

Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., called a meeting of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which he chairs, to hear testimony from experts on energy trends.During a discussion of carbon capture technologies — ways to capture, transport and bury atmospheric carbon dioxide deep underground  — Manchin cited several statistics about the trend lines during the past decade for coal-fired power plants. Manchin said that China, India, and other major nations have increased the number of coal-fired power plants, while the U.S. has decreased its number.""The United States had 589 (coal-fired plants) 10 years ago,"" Manchin said during the Nov. 16 hearing. ""We're down to 504. … We are the only nation that has reduced our reliance as far as in coal energy.""We decided to check Manchin’s math.How many coal-fired plants are there in the U.S.?Manchin’s deputy press secretary, Jeremy Ortiz, told PolitiFact West Virginia that the senator was referring to coal plant data from the Global Energy Monitor, a nonprofit group that tracks energy data. The group’s Global Coal Plant Tracker collects data on all coal-fired power plants that generate at least 30 megawatts of power.Manchin’s figure for current coal-fired plants — 504 — is close to one of the figures in the Global Coal Plant Tracker database. However, Manchin used the wrong terminology to describe this number.Data from the tracker show that there are 498 coal-fired units in the U.S., and that’s not far from 504. But notice what is being counted: units, rather than ""plants,"" which is the word Manchin used. The tracker’s database counts a much smaller number of coal-fired plants in the US. — 246.So what’s the difference?""​​Units often consist of a boiler and turbine, and several units may make up one coal-fired power station,"" said Flora Champenois, a coal research analyst with the Global Energy Monitor. ""Interchanging the terms for plants and units is inaccurate."" For example, she said, the Clifty Creek station in Indiana is one power plant, but it operates six units.Has the U.S. been closing coal-fired power plants over the past decade?U.S. coal capacity did peak a decade ago at around 340 gigawatts and has declined to 232 gigawatts today, Champenois said. Low-carbon alternatives have increasingly become competitive with coal on price, and the shift away from coal has been reinforced by increased attention among utilities, governments and the public to carbon emissions’ role in driving climate change.Featured Fact-checkInstagram postsstated on January 23, 2023 in social media posts on January 23, 2023Electrically charged stones discovered in Congo.By Loreben Tuquero • January 26, 2023Champenois added that while the U.S. has been retiring coal-fired plants at a ""record pace,"" it is not on track to meet the goals set by the Paris Agreement, the global climate accord that the U.S. rejoined earlier this year.Have other countries reduced their reliance on coal?Champenois said that the U.S has retired more capacity, measured in gigawatts, than any other country since 2000, which supports Manchin’s assertion that no other country has reduced its reliance on coal for energy as much as the U.S. has.But many other countries have been cutting back, too.China has retired a lot more coal-fired units than the U.S. has, and many of the European Union’s 27 countries have retired a much larger percentage of their existing capacity, Champenois said.The EU has reduced coal consumption by half since 2015, Sean O’Leary, senior researcher at the Ohio River Valley Institute, told PolitiFact West VirginiaThat said, measuring the impact of these reductions in countries like China and India is tricky.Despite the pace of coal-fired retirements, China, India and the rest of the world have also added coal-fired power units, plants and capacity during the past decade, producing net increases in all three metrics. By contrast, the U.S. has seen decreases in all three.China has been adding non-coal assets at a faster pace than it’s adding coal-fired assets, meaning that coal’s share of its energy portfolio has been declining.""Although China is increasing generation from coal, coal's share of Chinese generation has been declining since 2010, and China has announced its intention to reduce coal-fired generation starting in 2026,"" O’Leary said.Despite the complexities of measuring the global changes in coal use, O’Leary said that Manchin overstated how unusual the United States’ transition away from coal has been.""The notion Manchin tried to convey, that the U.S. is alone in cutting reliance on coal while the rest of the world bounds ahead, is just plain wrong,"" O’Leary said. Our rulingManchin said the U.S. had 589 coal-fired plants 10 years ago, and ""we're down to 504. … We are the only nation that has reduced our reliance as far as in coal energy.""Manchin is broadly right to note that the U.S. has decreased its reliance on coal for generating electricity over the past decade, although he incorrectly labeled the units of measurement that went along with his figures.He also has a point that the U.S. has led the world in the number of retirements of coal-fired assets, but it’s worth noting that the U.S. is not alone, as other countries have also made significant cuts in coal-fired power over the same period.We rate the statement Half True.",Joe Manchin,"December 10, 2021",half-true
144,Jon Greenberg,The Build Back Better Act “includes $34.5 billion in cuts” for charity care funding to hospitals.,"Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott regularly attacks the Democrats’ Build Back Better Act as a formula for more inflation and government overspending. But his latest criticism chastises the $1.75 trillion package for the money it would not spend.The bill would reduce the money that compensates hospitals for charity care. That’s when they treat patients and don’t recoup their costs, generally because the patient either has no insurance or has Medicaid, which doesn’t fully cover the cost of care. Not every state would have to worry about this provision. The change targets the 12 states that rejected federal help to expand Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act. Florida is one of them.Scott’s office said in a Dec. 7 press release that he had sent a letter to Florida hospitals ""warning them of the dangerous provision within Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spending bill that includes $34.5 billion in cuts to Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments (DSH) and states’ Uncompensated Care Pool (UCP) programs.""""These programs are used to fund charity care by hospitals for patients who are uninsured and underinsured,"" the release said.Scott’s claim is accurate about the size of proposed cuts to charity care programs, but it provides an incomplete picture of the bill’s impact on health funding. He leaves out the estimated $43.8 billion in the Build Back Better Act to give private health insurance to the people who would have been covered under Medicaid expansion — money that would presumably reduce the need for federal spending on charity care.""Claiming that the Build Back Better Act would slash charity funds without accounting for increased spending that would expand coverage, and so decrease the need for such charity funds, is misleading,"" said David Gamage, professor of health policy law at the University of Indiana.Scott’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment.Aid for hospitalsFor decades, Medicaid has sent federal money to the states to help so-called disproportionate share hospitals. These are hospitals that treat especially large numbers of people without insurance or who are on Medicare or Medicaid.Washington also offered another pot of money that tackled the same problem for states that get permission to create their own uncompensated-care pools.For the 12 states that did not accept federal money to expand Medicaid eligibility, the Build Back Better Act would reduce the money for both programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that by 2031, the total reduction will be about $34.5 billion. That’s the cut Scott cites.People caught in the Medicaid gapBut the proposed cut in hospital aid wouldn’t take place in a vacuum. It is part of a strategy to insure people who have fallen through the cracks of government insurance programs. These are people who make too much or otherwise don’t qualify for Medicaid in their state, yet are too poor to qualify for the premium tax credits through the Affordable Care Act exchanges, which are available only to people above the poverty line.When the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, the idea was that between subsidized private-insurance premiums and making Medicaid available to more people, just about every legal resident would have access to some kind of insurance. (Adults living in the country without permission are not covered.) That assumed that every state would take advantage of federal help to expand Medicaid. When the Supreme Court ruled that states could opt out, that created a group of people caught in the middle.These are people whose incomes are below the poverty line — many work in low-wage jobs — but they don’t qualify for their state’s Medicaid program because they make too much or don't have children. And they don’t qualify for subsidized private insurance, because the way the law was written, people below the federal poverty line aren’t eligible. Today, an estimated 2.2 million people fall in this gap.The 12 states where this matters are Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming.How the Build Back Better Act would address the gapClosing the gap has been a Democratic focus for some time. The Build Back Better Act aims to do so by steering more money to private insurance subsidies. In its first four years, the Build Back Better Act would provide $59.3 billion to subsidize private insurance through the exchanges for the people caught in the gap. The aid ends in 2026. Over the same period, it would reduce hospital aid by $13.9 billion. With more insured people, the reasoning goes, hospitals would need less money to cover uncompensated charity care.This trade-off is not a new idea. Melinda Buntin, formerly at the Congressional Budget Office and now a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University, said it was written into the Affordable Care Act, even if repeatedly deferred. The law took the linkage for granted.Featured Fact-checkInstagram postsstated on January 11, 2023 in an Instagram post“More contraception availability increases abortion demand.""By Samantha Putterman • January 18, 2023""The ACA clearly cut Disproportionate Share payments in anticipation of hospitals seeing fewer uninsured patients,"" Buntin said.How would expanded insurance coverage affect hospital finances?Many studies show that when states expanded Medicaid, their hospitals benefited because they were treating fewer people without insurance.A review of those studies by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that Medicaid expansion ""contributed to increased hospital revenue overall."" Medicaid might not fully reimburse a hospital for its costs, but even partial coverage was better than no payment at all. For the most part, hospitals saw a drop in the level of uncompensated care. However, the foundation’s review noted that some hospitals did better than others. One study found that ""only hospitals in non-metropolitan areas and small hospitals experienced improved profit margins."" In short, expanded insurance helps in general, but it is trickier to predict the impact on any particular hospital.Timing mattersIdeally, the number of uninsured people would drop before hospitals saw their federal compensation decline. The Build Back Better Act tries to account for that.Based on the CBO estimates, the new insurance premium subsidy would come in Year 1, and the first cut in uncompensated care funding would take place in Year 2. In the first four years, the bill would spend four times as much on helping people get insured as it would cut in hospital payments. (The subsidies would end after that, so over the 10 years, the net new spending would be $48.3 billion.)The Urban Institute, a Washington research center, ran the spending plan through its computer model and said ""in the years during which additional subsidies would be provided, hospitals overall would be substantially better off than they are under current law.""But again, the researchers cautioned that not all hospitals will necessarily do better. The reductions in government aid for them might not track with the increase in the number of insured patients. In particular, because only legal residents of the U.S. would be eligible for subsidies, ""hospitals serving a disproportionately high share of undocumented people would see less benefit,"" they wrote.Matthew Fiedler, a fellow with the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy, projected that most hospitals would be much better off, at least initially, under the proposals in the Build Back Better Act. If everything was in place by 2023, Fiedler estimated a gross gain of $11.9 billion in hospital margins across the 12 states that rejected Medicaid expansion.However, Fiedler told us that over a 10-year period, that wouldn’t last. The insurance subsidies would end, but the cuts would continue.""That suggests that the bill, as written, would be roughly a wash, or a bit better than that, for hospitals,"" Fiedler said.Fiedler said you have to be careful when comparing the new money for insurance subsidies to the cuts in charity care. He said a lot of the money to expand insurance would eventually make its way to hospitals, but some would go to doctors and drug makers, and a smaller share would go to the insurance companies.A major point of contention is how many people would sign up for the newly available insurance, and how quickly. The fewer who do, the smaller the financial relief to hospitals that treat them.""I don't buy the argument that all these people really value health insurance,"" said Joe Antos, a health policy analyst at the market-oriented American Enterprise Institute. ""They are used to being abused by the health system. Do you really think they will have a view that I will definitely buy this insurance?""If the growth of the insured population doesn’t keep pace with the funding cuts, Antos said, he worries most about the ""true safety-net hospitals.""That said, no expert we talked to said the expansion of insurance wouldn’t provide some benefit to hospitals. Our rulingScott said the Build Back Better Act includes $34.5 billion in cuts to charity care funding for hospitals.Scott’s claim is accurate about the size of proposed cuts to charity care programs, but it fails to account for the $43.8 billion in the bill to provide insurance to people who don’t have it today, which would reduce the need for charity care.The impact of the package on individual hospitals will vary, depending on how fast people sign up for new insurance and local conditions. But the experts we heard from agreed that both changes need to be assessed together.We rate this claim Half True.",Rick Scott,"December 10, 2021",half-true
145,Julie Appleby,"""An independent analysis shows that payments for cancer care will be slashed by close to 45% causing cancer clinics to close and massively raising your healthcare costs.”","An advertisement from the Community Oncology Alliance, part of a $1.6 million campaign running both on radio airwaves and in print, attacks a proposal in the Democratic-backed Build Back Better package approved by the House last month and now headed to the Senate. The ads, which started on Nov. 29 and are set to run through Dec. 12, say parts of the legislation would have ""serious unintended consequences"" for cancer patients — specifically, that ""an independent analysis shows that payments for cancer care will be slashed by close to 45%, causing cancer clinics to close and massively raising your healthcare costs."" The alliance is an advocacy and lobbying organization representing physicians and clinics involved with cancer care.The Build Back Better plan is the Biden administration’s legislative proposal that includes an array of health provisions, from plans to curb prescription drug costs to expansion of Medicare coverage. The provision targeted by the alliance’s ad would empower the federal government to negotiate prices for a small set of yet unnamed expensive drugs, including cancer treatments, with the aim of lowering prices, an important campaign promise by both President Joe Biden and numerous congressional Democrats. That got us wondering: Would the plan really result in reduced payments for cancer care and higher health care costs, as the ads claim?Because drug pricing and negotiations — as well as the Senate action on the proposal — are such hot news right now, we took a closer look.The experts we talked to expressed no doubt that certain provisions of the Build Back Better proposal, if passed into law, would reduce some payments to oncology offices. But we found that the advertisement leaves out key details about the scope of those cuts, an omission that could mislead people who hear or see the ads. About that cutThe oncologists’ ad is just one of many ads in recent weeks seeking to sway opinions as Congress considers legislation that would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, something it currently cannot do.At the root of the ad’s claim is the way Medicare pays for drugs administered in doctors’ offices. These payments are particularly important to some specialists, including oncologists. Lower prices paid by the government for these drugs also result in less administrative revenue for physician offices.Oncologists and other specialists provide injections or infusions in a medical office, covered by Part B of Medicare. Medicare reimburses physicians for the cost of the drug based on its average sales price, plus a 6% ""add-on"" payment, which is meant to cover the cost of overhead, staffing and the effort that goes into purchasing the drug. (Pre-pandemic, those payments were reduced to 4.3% under a complicated budget sequester process but were reinstated at the higher level for the duration of the health emergency.)The percentage-based payment formula has the unintended consequence of incentivizing expensive drugs over lower-cost options: A 6% add-on to a $10,000 drug translates to a lot more money than for a $1,000 drug.Over the years, pharmaceutical companies and physician groups, including the Community Oncology Alliance, roundly criticized attempts to change the formula and succeeded in killing proposals.The Build Back Better Act, as passed by the House, would have Medicare negotiate prices for a small number of high-priced drugs, including those used by oncologists under Part B, starting in 2025. At first, only 10 drugs would be selected, and the list would grow to 20 in 2028.There would be an upper limit on price, called the Maximum Fair Price, which is expected to be lower than average sales prices. That would save Medicare and taxpayers money on those drugs.Patients, too, might save money because their copays are set as a percentage of the cost of the drug. Oncologists would still get a 6% add-on fee for overhead and administration, but that 6% would be on a lower price, hence the decrease in revenue that concerns the doctors.What the oncologists sayWe reached out to the Community Oncology Alliance to ask about the ad’s assertions that payments for cancer care would be cut by 45%. It provided a number of reports, including one it commissioned by consulting firm Avalere Health, that calculated the possible revenue loss, and a separate study that tracks mergers, acquisitions, closures and financial matters affecting oncology practices.For its report, Avalere chose 10 drugs it thought were likely to make the administration’s list, then calculated the likely negotiated price and the resulting add-on payments.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 18, 2023 in a Facebook post“The average American has anywhere from 5 to 15 pounds” of stool stuck in their gut.By Madison Czopek • January 27, 2023While it varies by specialty, the overall average reduction in add-on revenue would be 39% for those specific 10 drugs, with physician offices seeing a 44.2% drop, and hospitals seeing a 36% decline, said Milena Sullivan, a principal with the health policy team at Avalere and the report’s lead author.But the wording in the ad — ""payments for cancer care will be slashed by close to 45%"" — glosses over the specifics of that finding. It seems to suggest overall revenue for community cancer clinics would be cut 45%, whereas the reduction identified in the study affects only a segment of their revenue: the add-on payments for some of the drugs that clinics and physicians provide.""They commissioned an analysis that did not look at the total impact on community oncology practice finances. They looked just at drugs affected, which wildly inflates impact,"" said Peter Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and an expert on drug costs.Without details on what percentage of a practice’s revenue comes from the add-on payments for a specific set of drugs that has yet to be defined, ""we don’t know how much this is going to reduce oncologists’ income,"" said Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow in health care policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.Ted Okon, executive director for the alliance, defended the wording, saying, ""You can only say so much in an ad.""""Those are the biggest drugs out there,"" Okon said. ""If you take a hit of 42.9% on 70% of your practice, or even 60%, you are dead in the water.""However, the alliance didn’t have specific data on the overall percentage of revenue that the add-on payments represent.Will cancer clinics close?Okon argues that the revenue hit will be substantial enough that it would lead some practices to close, others to merge and still others to be sold to hospitals. The new maximum prices in Medicare would also affect how private insurers calculate their payments, he said, possibly adding to the revenue woes.Already, financial pressures have led to closures, mergers or financial difficulty for more than 1,700 community practices over the past 12 years, shifting a portion of cancer care ""from independent practice settings to hospitals,"" he said.He thinks that reduces patient choice and could also lead to higher costs for Medicare and patients, because they then seek care at hospitals, which are more expensive.Joseph Antos, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, expressed doubts. He said that the Avalere analysis looks correct and that practices will lose a chunk of revenue from add-on payments.""The impact would be pretty substantial,"" he said. ""But that doesn’t mean this business about clinics closing is right.""Our rulingThe advertisement says an independent analysis shows that under the Build Back Better bill as it’s currently written, ""payments for cancer care will be slashed by close to 45% causing cancer clinics to close and massively raising your healthcare costs.""The advertisement leaves out important context about the analysis.For one, the cuts it cites are to an unspecified portion of oncologists’ revenue, the add-on revenue for administering certain drugs. Secondly, it isn’t yet known which drugs will be affected. The cuts may well prove substantial for some practices, particularly those that use a lot of the treatments ultimately selected for price negotiation. As to closures, even without this change, some clinics will face financial stress leading to mergers, or sales to hospitals, mirroring what is happening in other sectors of the health industry.The argument that fewer clinics could lead more patients to get cancer care in hospitals — at higher costs to them, to Medicare and to private insurers — is economically plausible. But lower cancer drug costs in Medicare would mean savings for patients, since the program limits copayment amounts for patients who don’t have supplemental insurance to cover those costs.We rate the ad Half True.",Community Oncology Alliance,"December 7, 2021",half-true
146,Becca Schimmel,A chart shows China and India are leading in per capita carbon dioxide emissions.,"Are China and India wildly outpacing the U.S., United Kingdom, Germany and Japan on emissions of carbon dioxide? A chart shared on Facebook shows a staggering increase in carbon dioxide emissions in China and India since 1990, while showing declines for the U.S. and other developed countries over the same time.On Facebook, a user sharing the chart asked: ""Why are we weakening our economy?"" They cited the New York Post as the source.The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)This is the image from the Facebook post, which originated from a New York Post opinion article.It’s important to know what the chart shows, and what it doesn’t.It’s important to know what the chart shows, and what it doesn’t.While the headline on the graphic says ""Per capita CO2 emissions,"" what the lines on the chart show is the percentage change in CO2 emissions from 1990 to 2019 for China, India, Japan, the U.S., Germany and the United Kingdom. It appeared alongside an Oct. 26 opinion article in the New York Post headlined ""Why destroy our economy to cut emissions — when China and India are spewing away?"" The piece ran ahead of the international climate change conference of world leaders in Glasgow, Scotland, called COP26. The opinion article, written by Eddie Scarry, sourced the data in the chart from Our World in Data, a project of Oxford University. So we asked Hannah Ritchie, a senior researcher for Our World in Data, to tell us more about it. Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on January 17, 2023 in an Instagram postGreta Thunberg staged an arrest in Germany.By Ciara O'Rourke • January 19, 2023Ritchie offered a simple explanation: Because China and India had very low levels of per capita emissions in 1990, when their economies were far less developed, their emissions have grown a lot since then. Readers wouldn’t know it from this graphic, but the U.S., U.K., Germany and Japan already had high levels of emissions, which didn’t change very much over the same period.A different way of looking at the data provides more context. Our World in Data provided a similar chart looking at per capita CO2 emissions for the same countries and time periods. The difference in this chart is that it shows not the percentage change, but rather the actual change in per capita emissions over time, measured in tons. This version of how the data is presented shows the U.S. and Japan leading in per capita CO2 emissions. The difference in charts from Our World in Data depends on whether the ""relative change"" option was selected. Checking this box shows the percentage change over time and makes it appear as though China and India are leading in CO2 emissions compared with other developed nations. The Facebook post is missing context because it shows the change in emissions per person, but not the actual emissions. The United States is responsible for the largest share of historical emissions with about 509 gigatons of carbon dioxide released since 1850. China has the second-largest share of historical emissions with more than 284 gigatons. Simon Evans, deputy editor for Carbon Brief, analyzed why cumulative CO2 emissions matter in an Oct. 5, 2021, article. He wrote: ""There is a direct, linear relationship between the total amount of CO2 released by human activity and the level of warming at the Earth’s surface. Moreover, the timing of a ton of CO2 being emitted has only a limited impact on the amount of warming it will ultimately cause.""This means CO2 emissions from hundreds of years ago continue to contribute to the heating of the planet — and current warming is determined by the cumulative total of CO2 emissions over time."" Our ruling A Facebook post shows China and India leading in per capita CO2 emissions compared to the U.S., U.K., Germany and Japan between 1990 and 2019. The chart is missing some context, and the headline is misleading. When looking at the percentage change in per capita CO2 emissions from 1990-2019, China and India have seen the largest increases. Both countries had relatively low emissions in 1990, and they have grown a lot since then. The U.S., U.K., Germany and Japan already had high levels of emissions in 1990, and they have remained at high levels, with the U.S. leading the pack.We rate this claim Half True.",Facebook posts,"December 2, 2021",half-true
147,Jon Greenberg,“39 out of 42 (countries) in Europe have more restrictive abortion laws” than Mississippi.,"The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case of a pivotal Mississippi abortion law Dec. 1. With a conservative majority on the court, the future of Roe v. Wade, the rule that has guided abortion laws for five decades, is in question.The Mississippi law makes most abortions illegal after 15 weeks, about two months earlier than the 24 weeks that the courts have generally approved. The statute provides narrow exceptions for abortion beyond 15 weeks. It would be allowed to protect the life of the woman, or if there was ""a serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function."" A major bodily function includes ""functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, and digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions."" In an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said the law is actually more permissive than the laws across Europe.""In Europe, there are 42 countries that allow elective abortions,"" Reeves said Nov. 28. ""If Roe is overturned and this 15-week ban in Mississippi is allowed to go into effect, Mississippi will still have a law on the books in which 39 countries — 39 out of 42 — in Europe have more restrictive abortion laws than what I believe to be one of the most conservative states in the United States.""We decided to see if Reeves had his numbers right.We found that there are different ways of categorizing abortion laws in Europe. Reeves relied on one analysis, but that study made no allowances for broad exceptions in countries’ laws that could extend the cutoff point for a legal abortion well past the 15-week mark. We counted at least 15 countries where that could happen, with potentially 11 additional ones.Reeves’ numbers are not as solid as he suggests.Many legal nuancesReeves’ office told us his data came from a report by the Charlotte Lozier Institute, an anti-abortion study center. Chief Justice John Roberts referred to it during oral arguments.The authors made it clear that they weren’t looking at every European nation, just those that they consider to allow elective abortions. Elective is the key word. As the Lozier Institute defines it, it means when a woman can seek an abortion without meeting certain conditions.This definition eliminated eight countries, including Britain (with a 24-week cutoff) and Finland (with a range of cutoffs from 12 to 20 weeks), because, the authors argued, the laws there required women to provide ""some"" justification for an abortion beyond it being their choice.But their definition of ""elective"" can be subjective. In Britain, two medical professionals have to agree that a woman’s mental or physical health is at risk. In the Netherlands, a doctor has to agree with the woman’s claim that she faces a ""distressed situation."" The Lozier Institute study counts the Netherlands, but excludes Britain.  (Northern Ireland, the other part of the United Kingdom, is included.)That said, within the group of countries they selected, the authors looked at the cutoff point for legal abortions before considering any special factors, such as profound fetal abnormalities, or factors affecting the woman.""Out of the 42 European countries that allow elective abortion, 39 countries limit elective abortion to 15 weeks’ gestation or earlier,"" the report said.Contrast that with an assessment of a group of European law professors in their amicus curiae brief on behalf of the woman’s abortion clinic in the Mississippi case.""Abortion is permitted through at least 22 weeks of pregnancy in 37 states and through 18-21 weeks in a further three, either on request, or on broad socioeconomic grounds, or on a ... criterion that does not entail a risk to her life,"" they wrote.So, which analysis is correct?""As always, the devil is in the details,"" said Federico Fabbrini, professor of law at Dublin City University School of Law and Government. Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 18, 2023 in a Facebook postDocument shows that Hunter Biden paid Joe Biden $50,000 a month in rent.By Samantha Putterman • January 19, 2023For example, the great majority of European countries — 27 by our count — have a basic cutoff point of 12 weeks. But nearly all of those countries have exceptions that extend the period, often as long as 22 weeks.What one makes of those exceptions influences the comparison between Mississippi and Europe.""On its face, a 15-week limit is more permissive than a shorter limit,"" said Carter Snead, a law professor at University of Notre Dame. ""Some have suggested that the European laws are more permissive because of their various exceptions, but this strikes me as mere speculation, because to assess that claim we would need to compare how such exceptions are interpreted and enforced alongside the Mississippi law's exceptions.""The Lozier Institute took a narrow approach. Its study looked at one part of each country’s law — the baseline period during which elective abortions are legal. It didn’t factor in the reasons that period could be extended or for how long. ""Looking at abortion laws in their broader context reveals that comparable countries which, on their face, set shorter time limits on abortion access than the United States, often provide greater flexibility in obtaining abortions after those limits pass, with exceptions for a broad range of circumstances,"" according to a brief from a group of law professors in support of the abortion clinic.Two of the most flexible terms are socioeconomic conditions and the mental health of the woman.With the help of several databases — one from the United Nations, one from the World Health Organization, and a list from the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard — we examined the text of the laws of the countries the Lozier Institute examined, sometimes using Google Translate for our research.The base cutoff periods for legal abortion in these countries broadly fall into three categories: 10 to 12 weeks’ gestation, 12 to 14 weeks, and 15 or more.In the most restrictive category, 10 to 12 weeks, are 24 countries, including Northern Ireland. But 15 of those countries have exceptions for specific economic or mental-health reasons that extend the cutoff to 15 weeks or more.The middle category, 12 to 14 weeks, includes 15 countries. All but four of these countries have exceptions for the health of the mother. Their laws don’t say if health is limited to physical health, or if it extends to mental health — a more subjective criterion. But if the exceptions apply broadly, they can extend the legal period for an abortion to the 15-week point or beyond.Just three countries — Iceland, the Netherlands and Sweden — are in the least restrictive group. (Britain is excluded, as we noted above.)!function(e,i,n,s){var t=""InfogramEmbeds"",d=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(""script"");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,""infogram-async"");Martha Davis, a law professor at Northeastern University, cautioned that text of any law alone fails to capture the full picture of abortion availability in Europe. It also depends on how those laws are applied.Based on the text, there could be as few as 13 countries with shorter cutoff periods than Mississippi’s 15 weeks. Depending on how laws are applied, though, there might be 24 in that group. The gap between what’s written and what's practiced creates a gray zone. Some studies suggest that Belgium offers more flexibility than meets the eye.Even with those uncertainties, it is difficult to get to Reeves’ claim of 39 nations once laws with exceptions for the life circumstances and mental well-being of the woman are taken into account.Supporters of abortion rights argue that this sort of quantitative legal analysis comes with inherent limits.""More than just exceptions to the abortion limitation itself, a country’s laws and policies on access to comprehensive sex education, modern contraception, paid parental leave, paid child care also are part of the context of abortion laws,"" said Mindy Roseman, director of International Law Programs at Yale University.Our rulingReeves said that ""39 out of 42 (countries) in Europe have more restrictive abortion laws"" than Mississippi.He relied on a study that looked only at one part of each nation’s law — the part that defined the initial time period for elective abortions.Folding in the exceptions that many countries allow, the actual number could be one-third of what Reeves said.But it’s hard to be precise with the count or the comparison. Abortion laws are subject to interpretation, and our point is that the study Reeves relied on is just one possible approach to making the comparison.We rate this claim Half True.",Tate Reeves,"December 1, 2021",half-true
148,Nusaiba Mizan,"""U.S. households are on track to spend $19 billion more on energy by 2030.""","As President Joe Biden attended the United Nations conference on climate change and promised to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions ""while making it more affordable for consumers to save on their own energy bills,"" a Republican congressman from Texas claimed the opposite.In a one-minute speech on Oct. 28 in Congress, Rep. Roger Williams, R-Austin, claimed: ""U.S. households are on track to spend $19 billion more on energy by 2030."" That CSPAN video footage of his one-minute speech was tweeted by Williams on Nov. 1.Is he right? And how will U.S. household energy costs change in the future?American Petroleum Institute hypothetical analysisWhen asked about Williams' source, his office pointed to an analysis from the American Petroleum Institute, a lobbying organization for the oil and gas industry. The analysis was prepared for the institute by an energy consulting company, OnLocation Inc.The analysis is specific to one Biden proposal from the campaign trail: a ban on oil and gas operations on federal lands and water. Williams highlighted this at the beginning of his speech.The $19 billion figure comes from a September 2020 report prompted by a then-campaign promise by Biden to ban leasing and development for oil and gas operations on federal lands. The prediction is that U.S. households would spend a cumulative $19 billion more on energy by 2030 (in 2018 dollars).The institute extrapolated from and modified the assumptions of a model by the U.S. Energy Information Administration under the U.S. Department of Energy, which tracks energy market data and develops outlooks for the future.After Biden took office, he banned by executive order new leases for oil and gas production on public land and offshore waters until a review of the permitting and leasing program could be completed.The 2020 analysis was based on the proposal to ban new leases and permitting on existing leases, while Biden's executive order was on just new leasing, a spokesperson from the American Petroleum Institute said.However, the actual pause on leasing was brief because a federal court ordered in June for new leasing to resume. The Department of the Interior issued a release in August about the steps it took to comply with the preliminary injunction. The Justice Department also is appealing the decision to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.Featured Fact-checkInstagram postsstated on January 23, 2023 in social media posts on January 23, 2023Electrically charged stones discovered in Congo.By Loreben Tuquero • January 26, 2023A spokesperson from the Department of the Interior noted in a Nov. 17 email the pause on new leasing did not impact current oil and gas production.So, in criticism of Biden's policies, Williams used a statistic specific to a campaign promise which is currently not in effect.While the American Petroleum Institute does have an addendum to its analysis, the institute does not have a 2021 estimate of the potential effect on household energy costs if just new leasing remained on pause.A spokesperson from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, wrote in an email that under current laws and regulations, residential non-renewable energy expenditures are projected to increase by $18 billion (in 2020 dollars), from $247 billion to $265 billion.Ultimately, household energy forecasting is challenging — household energy prices depend on a range of hard-to-predict factors. The Energy Information Administration issued caution in its ""Annual Energy Outlook 2021"" that many events, as well as future technology and demographics, can ultimately affect energy markets.Our rulingWilliams said, ""U.S. households are on track to spend $19 billion more on energy by 2030"" because of Biden energy policies.The figure was specific to banning all new leasing and development for oil and gas operations on federal lands and waters. A ban of that scale did not go into effect; only new leasing was banned. And that ban is currently blocked by a federal judge.The statistic also speaks to only one Biden policy among many climate policies, some of which Biden claims aim to lower household costs.It's difficult to forecast household energy prices because a lot of factors affect them, and analysts have to hold a lot of factors constant to make predictions.For example, assuming laws and regulations remain the same, the Energy Information Administration estimates household expenditures will increase by $18 billion.We rate this as claim as Half True, which means the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.",Roger Williams,"November 30, 2021",half-true
149,Vivian Lam,"""Spike protein goes to nucleus and impairs DNA repair.""","The distinctive spike protein that covers the surface of the COVID-19 virus has inspired numerous misinformed claims about the vaccines that aim to prevent its spread. We have previously fact-checked claims on the purported toxicity of the spike protein relating to COVID-19 vaccines.An Oct. 13 paper claiming that the spike protein can cause DNA damage has circulated on social media, causing uncertainty about whether these findings are relevant to the COVID-19 vaccines. Without more context, the title of a YouTube video — ""Spike protein goes to nucleus and impairs DNA repair"" — may sound alarming.The lab-based context in which the study was conducted, however, limits its relevance to real life conditions outside the lab. And the study’s findings should not be directly translated to the COVID-19 vaccines, which use modified versions of the spike protein.A blog post about the claim was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The study in questionResearchers from two Swedish universities introduced into isolated human kidney cells genetic material containing instructions to produce different proteins that make up the COVID-19 virus, including the spike protein. They then examined where these proteins are primarily located in the cell, and tested whether the proteins affected the cell's DNA damage repair system.The researchers found that spike proteins were present in the cell nucleus, the part of the cell that houses DNA. They attributed a reduction in DNA repair efficiency to hindered recruitment of specific proteins involved in the repair process.Their findings differ from previous studies that have found the spike protein to be located primarily outside the nucleus. Studies on the related coronavirus that causes SARS have also found its spike protein to be located in areas outside the nucleus. Relevance to vaccinesThere are three main types of COVID-19 vaccines that are currently available or being tested in the U.S. Each one involves introducing modified versions of the spike protein to the body in order to prime the immune system to recognize the COVID-19 virus and build defenses against it. This modified version of the spike protein prevents it from assuming the structure that would normally allow it to fuse with the membranes of other cells, unlike the spike protein coded for in the kidney cell study.Unanswered questions also remain.Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on January 17, 2023 in an Instagram postCNN reported that Damar Hamlin’s doctor confirmed his cardiac arrest was caused by a COVID-19 vaccine booster.By Ciara O'Rourke • January 19, 2023""There are a lot of caveats before we can say there is a direct correlation between the vaccines and DNA repair,"" said Andre Hudson, head of the Thomas H. Gosnell School of Life Sciences of the Rochester Institute of Technology.One question, for example, is how the genetic material introduced into the kidney cells directed spike protein production: Was it the presence of the spike protein itself, or was it an overabundance of protein that led to their findings? Another question is replication: Can these findings be reproduced in other cell types or viruses that also use spike proteins? Does the age of the cells matter? ""A lot of experimental details are still needed before you can make a definitive conclusion,"" Hudson said.The Swedish researchers conducted an in vitro study, meaning it was conducted in a test tube or petri dish in a controlled lab environment. In vitro studies do not necessarily translate directly to what would happen in the much more complex biological environment of the body. Unlike the narrower parameters of an in vitro study, there are multiple cell types, immune responses and DNA repair mechanisms at play in people. ""Though they may have evidence that it happened in a cell line in an in vitro system, that doesn't mean that's the way it would act or behave in animals or people,"" said Hudson. ""Many studies have been done in vitro that don't translate to animal model systems.""Without replication in a study conducted on live animals or people, this study has limited clinical relevance to the COVID-19 vaccines.Our rulingBlog posts claim that a recent paper shows evidence that the spike protein on the COVID-19 virus can cause DNA damage, raising concerns about COVID-19 vaccine safety.The study, however, contradicts findings from previous studies that were also conducted on isolated cells in a lab environment.

Mexico would have to agree to the policy's reinstatement.But the Biden administration again expressed on Oct. 29 its goal to end the policy if the courts allow it through a memo by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. The memo said the policy likely reduced the flow of migrants, but Mayorkas opposed the policy for humanitarian reasons.Lt. Gov.

Excluding the recently released September data, which was published after Patrick made his statement, there were 1.5 million encounters.But 1.7 million encounters do not mean 1.7 million people tried to cross the border. Customs and Border Protection indicated in a news release on August operations that just over 1 million individuals were encountered year-to-date in fiscal 2021. A news release on September operations indicates agents encountered 142,710 individuals on the Southwest border in September.Those two values together place the number of individuals who tried to cross the border in fiscal 2021 at 1.1 million.So, Patrick was accurate when he said more than 1 million people were apprehended at the border this year.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 27, 2023 in a Facebook postU.S. Rep.

His office did not answer follow-up questions from PolitiFact Texas on which law enforcement entities made those estimates.The number of people who entered the U.S. illegally but were not apprehended is not available from Customs and Border Protection, but the Homeland Security Department does calculate border security metrics.The methodology behind the Border Patrol's migrant apprehension rate is presented in annual reports. The latest available report is the 2020 report with fiscal 2018 data. Some of these metrics rely on estimates of the number of people who crossed the border undetected.The apprehension rate was 70% in 2018. Ruth Wasem, who teaches policy courses on immigration at the University of Texas LBJ School of Public Affairs, noted this rate suggests the number of people who were not apprehended this year would be lower than Patrick's estimate.Patrick's estimate of 2 million or 3 million people would mean two-thirds or more of migrants weren’t apprehended.That might have been the case in the early 2000s when the apprehension rate ranged from 33% to 43%, but not now, Wasem said. The apprehension rate generally has increased over time.In an October Fox News interview, the former head of the Border Patrol, Rodney Scott, said there were more than 400,000 ""got aways"" over the past year.The Migration Policy Institute estimates 500,000 to 600,000 people entered the country without authorization and were not apprehended last year.""There's also been statements from CBP officials throughout the year that they're seeing about 1,000 got aways per day.

Bryan Steil, R-Janesville, sent out this tweet: ""Our border is wide open and now (President Joe) Biden is in talks to pay illegal immigrants $450,000. This is unbelievable."" Is the Biden administration really in talks to pay out $450,000 to illegal immigrants?Let’s just say it’s far more complicated than the tweet suggests.Payments are a result of ‘zero-tolerance’ policy during Trump administrationSteil’s tweet includes a link to a Wall Street Journal article from Oct. 28, 2021, and an image of an excerpt, with $450,000 circled. The article covers the fact the U.S. is in talks to pay settlements of ""around $450,000 a person"" to resolve lawsuits filed on behalf of parents and children that were separated at the border during the Trump administration. Those lawsuits -- and the fact federal taxpayers may be on the hook for major payouts if the government loses -- were not mentioned in Steil’s claim.When asked for backup for the claim, Steil’s office simply pointed us to the same article.Let’s look at what happened. About 5,500 children were separated from their parents at the southern border under President Donald Trump’s ""zero-tolerance"" policy, mainly in spring 2018, according to an Oct. 28, 2021 New York Times report. Under the Trump-era policy, thousands of children ranging from infants to teens were taken from their parents, with no provisions to later reunite them. During their time away from their families, many children suffered from issues including heat exhaustion, malnutrition, freezing temperatures and a lack of medical attention. The family separation policy was a key component of the administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration, aimed at deterring people from coming to the U.S. The policy also affected families that were legally entitled to asylum due to persecution in their home countries. So, in those cases, the families were not ""illegal immigrants"" at all, but people who followed the protocols for seeking asylum. Under the policy, Border Patrol agents charged parents with illegally entering the U.S., imprisoned them and placed their children in government-licensed shelters around the country, the New York Times report said. In early summer 2018, a judge ordered the government to rescind the policy, but government officials then struggled to reunite families. Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 27, 2023 in a Facebook postU.S. Rep.

Many families, the article said, would likely get smaller payouts, depending on their circumstances.The total potential payout could be $1 billion or more. In theory, if the cases were lost in court, the payouts could be higher.Only a minority of the families may be eligible for financial compensation, according to the Times report, because many impacted families have not filed complaints, perhaps for fear of reprisal from the government, the Times report said.Even Biden himself has weighed in on the payments, with his staff saying that he is comfortable with a settlement with families now in litigation, according to a Nov. 7, 2021 Politico report, though he has seemingly expressed disagreement with the $450,000 figure.Our rulingSteil claimed that the federal government ""is in talks to pay illegal immigrants $450,000."" But that vastly oversimplifies what is happening.The potential payments are the result of the Trump-era policy that saw thousands of children separated from their parents after crossing the southern border. And in some cases the families involved applied legally for asylum, and are not ""illegal immigrants"" at all.While the actual amount for the payouts is still under negotiation, some sources say that individuals could receive $450,000 or more.

We're now finally back to 500,000 jobs a month. We inherited a country where 4,000 people a day were dying from COVID. That's now down 75%.""These two metrics have improved under Biden, but Klain exaggerated the numbers on the difference between the records of the two presidents.Job growth figuresFirst, we looked at the monthly change in nonfarm employment during the five months prior to the first full jobs report on Biden’s watch. Those were September, October November, and December 2020, and January 2021. (Trump and Biden effectively shared responsibility for the January 2021 figures.)During one of those months — December 2020 — employment shrank, by 306,000 jobs. In the other four, employment increased, and by a lot more than 50,000. It rose by 716,000 in September 2020, 680,000 in October 2020, 264,000 in November 2020, and 233,000 in January 2021.All told, the average gain during those five months, even including the big drop in December, was a bit over 321,000 per month, or more than six times what Klain said.After Biden took office, the job gains did increase.

(The October 2021 gain of 531,000 that Klain touted will also be revised either downward or upward over the next few months.)Even if we use the initial January 2021 figure of 49,000, that would ignore some significantly stronger figures during the fall of 2020. The initial, unrevised employment gains released by the BLS were 661,100 in September; 638,000 in October; and 245,000 for November.Coronavirus death statisticsKlain exaggerated the degree of improvement on COVID-19 as well.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data compiled by the Washington Post shows that the seven-day rolling average for daily coronavirus deaths on Jan. 20 — when Biden was sworn in — was 3,065.On Nov. 7, the day Klain appeared on ""Meet the Press,"" the equivalent figure was 1,185. That’s a decrease of 61%, or less than the 75% decline that Klain cited.Here, too, we think we know where Klain was getting his number. On Jan. 20, there were 4,400 coronavirus deaths. However, there are variations in when coronavirus deaths are reported, with the figures typically dropping on weekends when many public health offices are closed. So researchers recommend using a seven-day rolling average, which counts the previous seven days in order to smooth out the variations in data reporting.For this reason, it’s not unusual for a weekday — like Jan. 20, which was a Wednesday — to have a higher death total than the seven-day rolling average. In fact, the seven-day rolling average has never exceeded about 3,300 deaths per day during the entire pandemic.Our rulingKlain said the Biden administration inherited gains of ""50,000 jobs a month. We're now finally back to 500,000 jobs a month. We inherited a country where 4,000 people a day were dying from COVID. That's now down 75%.""The Biden administration can trumpet gains in both areas, but they are not as dramatic as Klain said. The job gains under Biden are almost twice as big as they were late in the Trump administration, not 10 times bigger.

Watkins that a person could not be denied the office of notary public for not being a believer because it ""unconstitutionally invades his freedom of belief and religion guaranteed by the First Amendment and protected by the Fourteenth Amendment from infringement by the States.""Since that ruling, those state bans have been rarely invoked, legal experts told The New York Times in 2014. The story cited cases in South Carolina and North Carolina, in which parties seeking to enforce the ban lost in court. The group American Atheists said in 2014 that the issue also came up in a Texas city council race.In Pennsylvania, there is no prohibition on atheists running for office in the state constitution, which says, ""No person who acknowledges the being of a God and a future state of rewards and punishments shall, on account of his religious sentiments, be disqualified to hold any office or place of trust or profit under this Commonwealth."" A Washington Post story counts the Keystone State as one of eight states with restrictions on atheists holding office. But it notes that Pennsylvania differs from the other seven states in that its rule is that believers can’t be disqualified from office but says nothing about atheists.While seven states still have clear language in their constitutions banning atheists from holding public office, Pennsylvania’s constitution isn’t as clear cut.

He used the same two numbers and said that ""almost half of the nation's (job growth) output was just in Florida.""We found that Florida does have reason to be pleased with its showing in jobs for September. But DeSantis’ comparison of the two figures is exaggerated.

But in this case, Florida did well on a percentage basis, too. In fact, measuring by percentage gains from the previous month, Florida would actually leapfrog Texas to No. 1 in the national rankings for job growth.That said, this state number may change, and the numerical comparison DeSantis made to national figures isn’t apples-to-apples. The numbers are subject to revision. Not only are these numbers preliminary, but figures for individual states have a larger margin for error than the national numbers do, and the eventual revisions made to the September numbers in subsequent months could make ""significant"" changes to the 84,500 figure, said Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist. (Of course, the revision could push the numbers higher, rather than lower.)There can be significant variations from month to month. During the previous month, Florida gained a net 20,500 jobs, or about one-fourth of the total in September. That ranked Florida 17th nationally for percentage job growth.The month-to-month variations can be especially affected by the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to ups and downs in what sectors are expanding or contracting at a particular time.

The biggest caveat is the relationship between the two numbers DeSantis cited in his post.The 84,500 figure he used comes from the state-by-state breakdown released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, whereas the 194,000 figure comes from the national survey. This may not sound like a big deal, but the smaller state-level counts are subject to greater uncertainty and error.Specifically, if you add up all the net job gains from the 34 states that gained jobs in September and subtract the net job losses in the 16 states that lost jobs that month, it produces a net gain of 363,000 jobs nationally. That’s a significantly larger figure than the national estimate.DeSantis’ juxtaposition made it seem like Florida accounted for 44% of the jobs created nationally. But that’s misleading. If you compare Florida’s 84,500 jobs gained to the national figure for net job gains from the same data set — 363,000 — Florida accounted for 23% of the nation’s job gains that month. Again, not a bad result, but not as good as the comparison DeSantis made.If you use the 194,000 figure, then the top three gaining states alone — Texas, Florida, and California — collectively produced a net 227,700 new jobs, which would be 117% of the new net job creation in September. Emilie Oglesby, director of communications and external affairs at the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, said that the administration ""stands by the statement that Florida is driving the nation’s positive economic activity.""Our rulingDeSantis said, ""The nation reported adding 194,000 jobs in September and Florida accounted for 84,500.""The 84,500 number was an impressive showing nationally, ranking second among the states in raw job gains and first as a percentage.However, state jobs numbers are more in flux than they may seem, because they are subject to revision and bounce around a lot from month to month. In addition, DeSantis’ numerical comparison contains a mismatch in the underlying data. The 194,000 figure is taken from a national calculation; the more accurate national figure to compare it to is 363,000.

During the past 20 years, the highest gas prices occurred in July 2008, during the Bush administration. But the statement leaves out important context. Some of the lowest prices of the past 20 years also occurred during the Bush administration, which included both the post-9/11 economic slowdown and the 2008 Wall Street crash and financial crisis. Indeed, gas prices have fluctuated within and across administrations, with little correlation to which president or party is in power. As with most things, the price of gasoline is determined not by the president, but rather by the state of the economy and the balance of supply and demand. Following our inquiries, Occupy Democrats changed its post to reflect this.Occupy Democrats cofounder Rafael Rivero told PolitiFact that the point of its original claim was to highlight the context that it says was missing from critiques of the Biden administration. The fact that prices were at historic highs during the Bush administration ""is conveniently ignored by the chorus of Fox News anchors blaming Biden for today’s rising prices,"" Rivero said.Today’s gas prices are around $3.32 a gallon, up from $2.37 when the Biden administration took office, according to the EIA. That’s still well off the peak of about $4.11 in July 2008.But Bush’s term also included two major economic shocks that sent gasoline prices tumbling. The first was the 9/11 attacks in 2001. By the end of that year, gas prices were around $1.07. The other was the 2008 mortgage crisis and Wall Street collapse, near the end of his second term. By the time Obama took over, gas prices were down to about $1.83.The intersection of supply and demandWhile the health of the economy influences the demand side of the price balance, global supply is largely controlled by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. ""OPEC tries to control the price of oil by either increasing or decreasing production to keep the price of oil stable,"" De Haan said. In 2001, the average price of oil set by OPEC countries was around $23 a barrel.

That’s when prices hit their peak above $4 a gallon. Then came the crash, followed by another recovery under President Barack Obama’s administration that sent prices back toward the $4 mark in 2011 and 2012. In November 2014, in order to compete with production in other countries like the U.S., OPEC changed its policy to produce as much oil as possible and flood the market, which led to very low prices. Those low prices continued into the Trump years, until OPEC once again adjusted its policy to raise prices.Why gas prices are up now Then in March 2020, the pandemic hit and oil demand plummeted.Under President Donald Trump, prices ranged from around $1.80 (near at the start of the pandemic) to $2.90.""Because Americans stayed home, the price of oil plummeted into negative territory for the first time ever,"" De Haan said, referring to the price of crude oil futures contracts. ""Demand for gasoline was down 60%, and along with it, the price of oil crashed.""That led to job cuts in the oil industry and a decline in production. But demand recovered quickly because of optimism surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine, De Haan said, and producers haven’t been able to ramp back up as quickly, leading to another spike in prices that continues today. ""Was that Trump’s fault? No. Was that Biden’s fault? No,"" De Haan said. ""The vaccines held the key to an increase in demand."" After PolitiFact’s inquiry, Occupy Democrats modified its post to add that point: ""The truth is that presidents have little if ANY effect on gas prices, which are dependent on the price of crude oil, which is determined by global supply and demand. High gas prices in 2008 weren't really Bush's fault, just like rising prices today aren't Biden's fault.""Our rulingAn Occupy Democrats Facebook post said gasoline prices were ""way higher"" under Republican President George W. Bush than today under President Joe Biden. Prices did peak during the Bush administration, but they also were very low at other points during his presidency. More broadly, experts say, movements in gas prices have little to do with who’s president.

Experts always caution that a president is not all-powerful in economic matters, since many factors beyond their control, from international oil supplies to changes in technology and demographics, can shape the health of the U.S. economy.That said, experts say Biden deserves some credit for the job gains on his watch, given the expansion of coronavirus vaccinations and the passage of his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which provided coronavirus aid and economic relief.Our rulingBiden said, ""We’ve created more jobs in the first eight months of my administration than any president in American history — total number of jobs created.""The raw numbers support Biden’s claim, but the talking point glosses over the reality that the U.S. economy remains about 5 million jobs under its pre-pandemic peak.

Youngkin does not offer this important perspective.   Youngkin’s bottom-of-the-barrel claim is based on a 2021 report by the National Center for Education Statistics, a branch of the U.S. Department of Education. The center examined the proficiency standards in each state in 2019 and assigned them ""equivalent scores"" on a 0-to-500 scale. Higher scores mean higher standards.""The study is intended to help readers understand the myriad state assessment results that are otherwise difficult to compare and to serve a policy need for reliable information that compares state standards,"" the report says. ""The study is not an evaluation of the various state assessments or of the quality of the states’ achievement standards, and the findings should not be interpreted as evidence of deficiencies in state assessments…""In other words, the study is not judging whether state proficiency standards tests  should be high, low or in the middle. It’s just offering data.The report focuses on reading and math tests in fourth and eighth grades.The equivalent score compares the percentage of students who are deemed proficient on state tests to the percentage that reach the proficiency standard on national tests.Virginia’s exams are called Standards of Learning tests, or SOLs, and are taken by all fourth and eighth graders, as well as some other grades. The national exam is taken by a representative sample of fourth and eight graders in each state. It’s called National Assessment of Education Progress but is better known as the ""Nation’s Report Card.""Virginia’s numbers In fourth grade reading, Virginia’s proficiency standards were the lowest among 49 states (excluding New Hampshire). The equivalent score was 200. The median score among states was 224. Tennessee had the highest score at 238.In fourth grade math, Virginia standards were again the lowest among 49 states. The equivalent score was 219. The median was 242. Colorado had the highest score at 257.In eighth grade reading, Virginia’s proficiency standards were lowest among 46 states measured. The equivalent score was 236. The median was 266. Kansas was highest, at 288.Virginia’s standards for eighth grade math were not measured, nor were those of 14 other states.

Youngkin says the state’s standardized tests should require students to attain high, aspirational learning levels.Virginia’s proficiency standards for reading were set in 2013 by a state school board appointed by Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell. The math standards were set in 2019 by a state school board appointed by McAuliffe and current Gov. Ralph Northam. McAuliffe deemphasized standardized testing when he was governor, a move that was cheered by many local school boards and gained bipartisan support in the General Assembly.Dan Gecker, president of the state school board, said Virginia’s proficiency standards are set with a practical goal rather than an aspirational one.

The NCES stresses that its equivalency ratings on standardized tests in states do not reflect how well students are learning in each state.

But the study itself analyzed the relationship between the percentage of population fully vaccinated and new COVID-19 cases reported over a seven-day period across 68 countries and across 2,947 counties in the United States. The periods varied slightly by area, but were in late August and early September.During that time frame, the study found, countries with a higher percentage of population fully vaccinated had a higher rate of new COVID-19 cases per 1 million people. The findings were similar in the U.S. Of the five counties with the highest vaccination rates, three of them — Chattahoochee (Georgia), McKinley (New Mexico) and Arecibo (Puerto Rico) counties — had above 90% of their population fully vaccinated while also being identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as high-transmission counties.But the study’s message was not that vaccination doesn’t work.

The post featured a picture of what appeared to be a yard sign that read: ""Roe wasn’t the beginning of women having abortions. Roe was the end of women dying from abortions.""The Facebook user posted a caption along with the photo that read: ""Tens of thousands of American women died while having unsafe back alley abortions before Roe v. Wade. We CAN’T go back."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)Did Roe v. Wade put an end to abortion-related deaths in the U.S.?The answer isn’t so simple. The number of women dying from causes related to abortion had been declining in the decades before Roe, thanks to medical advances and changes in state laws, and deaths still occur. But deaths from illegal abortions plummeted to a few, if any, in most years since the decision, and the mortality rate from legal abortions has fallen substantially.Deaths from abortions before Roe v. WadeBecause of the historical stigma attached to getting abortions, there is limited data available about the number of women who died as a result of the procedure.""Deaths for example were often coded as due to other causes to save families from shame, and we can only rely on estimates for illegal abortions,"" said Carole Joffe, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, who specializes in reproductive health and has extensively researched access to abortion services. ""No one was keeping careful track.""However, research suggests that even before the Roe decision, abortions were becoming less deadly than they had once been, with estimates of annual deaths dropping from the thousands in the 1930s to 260 in 1957.The discovery and popularization of antibiotics helped improve the safety of abortions, according to a 1948 study published in the American Journal of Public Health. That study also mentioned that the increased use of contraceptives had reduced the need for illegal abortions, leading to fewer deaths.A 1978 American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology study analyzed trends in abortion deaths in the U.S., and determined that from 1940 to 1950 and after 1965, ""deaths from abortion declined more rapidly than deaths from other causes associated with pregnancy and childbirth."" The Food and Drug Administration in 1960 approved the first commercially produced birth control pill and in the three years before Roe was decided, abortion had become legally available in a handful of states.That study concluded that ""the introduction of more effective contraception, and increased availability of legal abortion"" were the two most likely explanations for the ""accelerated decline in abortion-related deaths.""Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 16, 2023 in a photo on Facebook“Every single Republican blocked Ketanji Brown Jackson’s SCOTUS appointment.”By Sara Swann • January 17, 2023By the early 1970s, abortion-related deaths had become relatively rare.In 1972 — the year before Roe was decided and the first year for which data for abortion-related deaths was available — 24 women died from legal abortions, and 39 died from illegal abortions, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (The CDC categorizes an abortion as legal when it is performed by a licensed clinician within the limits of state law.)Deaths since Roe v. WadeThe number of deaths related to illegal abortions decreased to 19 in 1973 and dropped further, to six, by 1974, CDC data shows. From 1979 to 2017, the number of women who died in a year was never higher than two.Meanwhile, as deaths from legal abortions fluctuated in subsequent years, mortality rates declined.A study by the Guttmacher Institute, a global research group that supports women’s access to abortions, determined that as legal abortion access increased after Roe, ""mortality due to abortion dropped sharply.""""The trend was caused mainly by a decline in the absolute number of deaths from illegal abortion — especially after Roe v. Wade — from 39 in 1972 to two in 1976,"" the study concluded based on CDC data. ""After 1975, mortality due to legally induced abortion also fell — from more than three deaths per 100,000 abortions in 1975 to about one in 1976 and even fewer thereafter.""Abortion laws and safetyStudies show that abortion rates are similar, regardless of whether or not a country has legalized the procedure.Along with legal changes, medical advances play a role in reducing deaths. In countries where abortions are illegal, they are less deadly today than they once were. One factor is the changing methods used to induce abortions. A relatively common and inexpensive drug, misoprostol, is commonly used to end pregnancies, for example.""The same safe pills that one can get in an abortion clinic, one can order online,"" Diana Greene Foster, another UCSF professor specializing in reproductive health, told PolitiFact in an email. ""So the relationship between safety and illegality is likely less clear-cut now as long as pregnant people get the right pills.""Our rulingA Facebook post claimed, ""Roe was the end of women dying from abortions."" A caption on the post alludes to deaths from illegal abortions in non-clinical settings.Deaths from abortions were already becoming relatively rare by the time Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, as a result of medical advances and legal changes at the state level. But studies and experts say increased access to legal abortion after Roe v. Wade sharply reduced the number of pregnant women who died because of illegal abortions. CDC data shows that the number of women who died from causes related to illegal abortions was zero or close to zero for most years from 1979 to 2017.

Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader. ""In 2003, 2005 and 2006, Mr. President, you joined Senate Democrats in opposing debt limit increases and made Republicans do it ourselves,"" McConnell wrote in a letter to Biden, referring to when the Republicans controlled the Senate during the George W.

""You explained on the Senate floor that your ‘no’ votes did not mean that you wanted the majority to let the country default; but rather that the President’s party had to take responsibility for an agenda which you opposed. Your view then is our view now.""Both Biden and McConnell are focusing on time periods that match their argument: Democrats did join Republicans in voting to raise the debt ceiling during the Trump administration, and there were times during the George W. Bush administration when Democrats stuck Republicans with that responsibility. What’s different this time is that Republicans are using a different tactic.While the parties duel over who’s responsible, the clock is ticking. In late September, the House voted to raise the debt ceiling, but Senate Republicans have blocked such attempts. If the debt ceiling isn’t suspended or raised within weeks, the United States won’t be able to cover its bills, which could ripple through the U.S. economy. Congress has raised or suspended the debt ceiling about 80 times since 1960. For this fact-check, we will largely focus on the more recent time periods cited by Biden and McConnell.Some past votes were bipartisanBiden was referring to votes between 2017 and 2019 when lawmakers agreed to raise the debt ceiling. The party split varied for each vote with lawmakers in certain factions of the parties objecting. But it’s fair to call these votes bipartisan, since at least dozens of lawmakers from both parties voted in favor of the legislation. In September 2017, Trump reached a deal with Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to extend the debt limit, continue funding the government for three months and approve aid after Hurricane Harvey. In the Senate, 47 Democrats and 33 Republicans voted in favor of the legislation; in the House, 133 Republicans joined all of the Democrats to support the legislation. In February 2018, after a brief federal government shutdown, Trump signed a deal that included additional spending on defense and domestic programs, disaster aid and raised the debt limit. Lawmakers backed the bipartisan budget deal by wide margins.In August 2019, the Democrats controlled the House and the Trump White House negotiated a deal with Pelosi. Lawmakers from both parties helped pass the legislation. But debt ceiling votes have not always been bipartisan.Donald Marron, director of economic policy initiatives at the Urban Institute, in 2010 analyzed the previous five votes on raising the debt limit. He found that in 2004 and 2006, when the Republicans held the majority in the Senate, they delivered nearly all the votes to raise the debt ceiling. When the Democrats held the majority in 2009-10, their party delivered nearly all the votes to raise the debt ceiling.The only exception was 2007 when there was a divided government — a Republican president and a Democratic Senate — and a little more than half of the senators from both parties voted to raise the debt ceiling.  Featured Fact-checkInstagram postsstated on January 11, 2023 in an Instagram post“More contraception availability increases abortion demand.""By Samantha Putterman • January 18, 2023The bottom line is that the Senate holds the responsibility for raising the debt ceiling to avoid economic fallout.""The Senate has to deliver a debt limit increase,"" Marron wrote in 2010. ""And that means that the Senate majority has to deliver the votes. As a matter of politics, then, debt limit votes are a tax on the majority. The majority has to take the hit for increasing the limit, while the minority gets a free ride.""McConnell pointed to a vote in 2003, when only two Democrats and one independent joined Republicans in voting for raising the debt limit. Biden voted ""no"" on the vote.But on the same day, Biden voted for a smaller increase in the debt ceiling. In 2004, two Democrats joined Republicans in raising the debt limit. Biden missed the 2004 vote but said at the time, ""I would have cast a symbolic vote against an extension of the debt limit. Today’s fiscal mess, the transformation of historic surpluses into record deficits, is not an accident. It is the inevitable outcome of policies that consistently ignored evidence and experience.""In 2006, no Democrats joined Republicans in voting for the debt limit increase. Biden explained his no vote this way: ""Because this massive accumulation of debt was predicted, because it was foreseeable, because it was unnecessary, because it was the result of willful and reckless disregard for the warnings that were given and for the fundamentals of economic management, I am voting against the debt limit increase.""Why the 2021 debt ceiling duel is differentPartisan posturing between the parties over the debt isn’t unusual. But what is unusual this time is that Republicans are going further than the minority party has in the past by using the filibuster to force the Democrats to increase the debt limit.Democrats did not filibuster debt limit increases in 2003, 2004 and 2006, allowing Senate Republicans to raise the debt limit with a simple majority, said Andrew Carothers, a research analyst at the Bipartisan Policy Center.""This time around, Senate Republicans have already filibustered one bill that would have suspended the debt limit, are likely to filibuster another, and have shown no indication that they will allow Democrats to pass stand-alone legislation to raise or suspend the debt limit outside of the reconciliation process,"" Carothers said. Over the past decade, every increase in or suspension of the debt limit passed with bipartisan majorities, with the slight caveat that the 2014 debt limit increase passed the House with bipartisan support, but cleared the Senate on a party-line vote, Carothers said.Marc Goldwein, senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, tweeted that while debt limit increases are often partisan, cloture ""votes to allow for debt ceiling increases were generally unanimous prior to 2013. In other words, no one used to filibuster a debt limit increase — at least once it was agreed to.""Our rulingBiden said, ""Raising the debt limit is usually a bipartisan undertaking.""Democrats did help pass bipartisan legislation to raise the debt ceiling three times during the Trump administration.Biden used the word ""usually"" here for a good reason. As McConnell noted, there have been times when Democrats largely didn’t join Republicans in raising the debt ceiling. In 2006, Senate Democrats — including Biden — rejected raising the debt ceiling to take a stand on spending. Biden missed a debt ceiling vote in 2004 but said he would have objected to it.An analysis from the Urban Institute in 2010 of votes in the preceding years showed that, when in the minority, both parties relinquished the task of raising the debt ceiling on the majority party. When there was a divided government in 2007, raising the debt ceiling was a bipartisan deal. What sets 2021 apart is the Republicans’ use of filibuster to force Democrats to increase the debt limit.We rate this statement Half True. RELATED: The looming debt-ceiling showdown: What you need to knowRELATED: ​​Rick Scott blames Democrats for expanding the debt.

167,Louis Jacobson,"""The pharmaceutical industry has 1,400 lobbyists on Capitol Hill right now trying to stop"" Medicare drug price negotiation.","Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., took a shot at lobbyists for the pharmaceutical industry for blocking progress on a ""human infrastructure"" bill, particularly on a provision that would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices.During an Oct. 3 interview on NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" Sanders attacked drugmakers for spending lavishly to lobby Congress to fight an idea that polls have found is overwhelmingly popular. ""The time is now for us to stand up to powerful special interests who are currently spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to prevent us from doing what the American people want,"" Sanders said. ""We want to lower, substantially, prescription drug costs in this country, so we're not paying 10 times more for certain drugs than Canada and other countries. And the pharmaceutical industry has 1,400 lobbyists on Capitol Hill right now trying to stop us.""In the big picture, there’s little doubt that the pharmaceutical industry throws its weight around in Washington. But is Sanders correct about the number of lobbyists fighting the drug-negotiation provision? Not exactly.First, some background on the issue Sanders is referring to.Medicare, the federal program that covers health care costs for Americans over 65, is barred under current law from negotiating prices with pharmaceutical companies. To the frustration of Sanders and his allies, the pharmaceutical industry is interested in preserving the status quo, which keeps prices higher than they would otherwise be. (The industry argues that cutting prices would hamper innovation by shrinking the amount of money available for research and development.)A May 2021 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 88% of respondents favored allowing the federal government to negotiate for lower prices on medications, including 77% of Republicans.But pharmaceutical and health products companies have significant sway, spending more than $171 million on lobbying during the first half of 2021, according to OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan clearinghouse for campaign finance and lobbying data. That easily ranked No. 1 for any industry over that period; the second-place sector was electronics manufacturing and equipment, which spent $87 million.Asked about Sanders’ source for the lobbyist figure, his office pointed to a database of lobbyists maintained by OpenSecrets. The database counts 1,469 lobbyists whose subject area falls under the definition ""pharmaceuticals/health products.""This figure needs some important context.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 23, 2023 in a Facebook postVideo shows Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez crying after “Ted Cruz gets up and humiliates her to her face.”By Ciara O'Rourke • January 26, 2023For starters, the category in the database called ""pharmaceuticals/health products"" includes lobbyists representing more than just drugmakers. It also includes medical device makers, nutritional and dietary supplement companies, pharmaceutical wholesalers, and companies that make personal healthcare products, such as toothpaste, said Dan Auble, a senior researcher with OpenSecrets. These industries don’t necessarily have a dog in the Medicare drug negotiation fight.A different category in the OpenSecrets database is more narrowly focused on the kinds of companies that manufacture the types of drugs that would be affected by a new rule on Medicare negotiations: ""pharmaceutical manufacturing.""The ""pharmaceutical manufacturing"" category includes a smaller number of lobbyists: 794.It’s not clear that all 794 of these pharmaceutical manufacturing lobbyists would be lobbying against the drug-negotiation provision.One of the biggest such lobbying groups is the Association for Accessible Medicines, a group formerly known as the Generic Pharmaceutical Association. The group represents companies that make generic drugs, which would likely benefit from a provision like the one Sanders is seeking.According to OpenSecrets data, the Association for Accessible Medicines has 50 lobbyists. This doesn’t take into account other groups that might benefit from a drug-negotiation provision, such as individual companies that manufacture generic drugs. It’s impossible to tell from the OpenSecrets database whether a lobbying group or lobbyist would support or oppose Medicare drug negotiation, so the bottom-line number of drugmaker lobbyists fighting the negotiation provision is uncertain. Still, even if you add to the core ""pharmaceutical manufacturing"" category by including the biotechnology sector, the most recent number of lobbyists would be 1,098, Auble said. Our rulingSanders said, ""The pharmaceutical industry has 1,400 lobbyists on Capitol Hill right now trying to stop"" Medicare drug price negotiation.The pharmaceutical industry has a large and well-funded lobbying operation, but Sanders’ figure for lobbyists is exaggerated.

Gary Palmer, R-Ala., says he opposes the Democratic climate change plans because they will land heavily on families of modest means.In particular, Palmer warned that shifting toward clean energy will raise the price of natural gas at a time when tens of millions of Americans struggle to pay their energy bills. ""This impacts low-income people,"" Palmer said Sept. 13 at a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. ""Higher energy costs literally lead to more weather-related deaths.""Palmer went on to say that the reverse is also true.""There’s a study that indicated that as a result of the massive decline in natural gas prices that literally we’re saving 11,000 lives per year in the U.S.,"" he said.Palmer’s claim fairly represents the findings of a 2019 study on natural gas prices, but it takes a narrow view of the implications of Biden’s policies for combating climate change. And it leaves out important context about the connection between temperatures and mortality. We reached out to Palmer’s office and did not hear back. Price declines in 2005-10 and the effect on mortalityThe 11,000 lives estimate comes from a 2019 paper from three economists that linked lower wintertime deaths to declines in natural gas prices between 2005 and 2010. They looked at the deaths from causes that are particularly high in winter — primarily cardiovascular and respiratory problems. They found that those deaths went down at the same time that natural gas prices fell.Accounting for a number of other possible factors, they said the ""price decline caused a 1.6% decrease in the winter mortality rate for households using natural gas for heating."" And they said that the impact of the lower price was greater for households making under 150% of the federal poverty level.One of the researchers, economist Seema Jayachandran at Northwestern University, said their working theory was that with lower fuel prices, people kept their homes warmer. Jayachandran acknowledged that the study didn’t consider all the implications of using more natural gas.""We looked at mortality caused by households facing lower prices for home heating, but air pollution is another implication that we did not incorporate, and it affects mortality too,"" Jayachandran said.Emerging field of study: Connecting climate change, energy prices and healthPublic health researchers caution that the link between winter weather and mortality is poorly understood. One complicating factor is the seasonal flu. Its toll can vary greatly from year to year, as it did during the period in the study Palmer cited. A generally mild flu season, such as the one from 2006 to 2007, led to fewer deaths than the year before, quite apart from fuel prices or temperatures.""We still don’t know that it’s the overall colder temperatures that cause the higher mortality in the winter,"" said University of Washington professor of environmental and occupational health Kristie Ebi. ""Many deaths don’t occur in the coldest places. Hypothermia is a higher risk in Houston than in New York City.""Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on January 17, 2023 in an Instagram postGreta Thunberg staged an arrest in Germany.By Ciara O'Rourke • January 19, 2023Ebi noted that if colder temperatures increased deaths, then warmer winter temperatures ought to reduce them. But ""despite warmer temperatures from 1985 to 2012, cold-attributed mortality increased in the U.S.,"" Ebi said.Other researchers —focused on the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels like natural gas — look at deaths when it’s hot.In a 2020 study published in GeoHealth, a group of researchers estimated that higher temperatures caused 12,000 premature deaths each year in the U.S.A review of over 400 studies found that ""most research on household energy does not consider climate change."" But what that review found suggested that the effects of climate change are particularly dangerous for the very people Palmer mentioned at the hearing.""Mortality from heat waves disproportionately affects older, minority and low-income residents who are less equipped socially, economically and physiologically to withstand high temperatures,"" the authors wrote. ""After the 1995 Chicago heat wave, there was a clear demographic disparity in mortality rates — lower-income and older people died at much higher rates than the rest of the population.""Easing the impact on low-income householdsFor perspective, today's natural gas prices are up from recent lows as economic activity recovers, but not even close to historical highs. They are about where they were in 2010.That said, the issue Palmer raises about natural gas costs is real. If the country seeks to cut back natural gas production to curb emissions, it’s possible that the price will rise. If that happens, low-income families that rely on natural gas would be vulnerable. The Biden administration has plans to reduce those households’ energy bills by helping them consume less. It’s promoting programs to cut the cost of insulating and weatherproofing people’s homes and apartments. It wants to make home appliances more efficient.Whether that’s enough to offset the higher energy prices is an open question.""Energy efficiency has historically helped to address some of the energy cost burdens for the poor, but it usually does not go far enough to really shield them from the economic shocks of high energy pricing,"" said Diana Hernandez, a researcher at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.It might also be difficult to tease out the impact of climate change policies on energy prices. Global prices are spiking primarily because demand is outpacing supply. But that’s a global phenomenon, not driven by U.S. policy. And concern about climate change may be a contributing factor: Investors are wary of sinking millions into new natural-gas production capacity at a time when the global appetite appears to be shifting toward renewable sources.Our rulingPalmer said, ""As a result of the massive decline in natural gas prices, we’re saving 11,000 lives per year in the U.S."" That claim fairly represents a study’s findings. But the study looked narrowly at wintertime mortality related to prices, without taking into account other implications of increased natural gas use, such as air pollution.Public health researchers warned that variation in seasonal flu and other factors make it difficult to draw clear links between cold and mortality. Meanwhile, other research finds that warmer temperatures due to climate change cause 12,000 premature deaths a year.Palmer’s claim is partly accurate, but takes a narrow view of the implications of Biden’s policies for combating climate change and leaves out important context about research on the connection between temperatures and mortality.

That occurs about six weeks into pregnancy, before many women realize they are pregnant. The law challenges longstanding precedent that allow abortions until a fetus is viable outisde the womb, at about the 22nd to 24th week of pregnancy.""Time and again Glenn Youngkin has made it clear: He would ban abortion as governor,"" McAuliffe tweeted on Sept. 17.

Youngkin’s campaign says this refers to repealing changes to abortion laws passed by Democrats since they took control of the General Assembly in 2020.

173,Duncan Slade,"“West Virginia University just came out with a study that showed that there will be almost 20,000 jobs created in clean energy in West Virginia if (President Joe Biden’s) agenda is passed.”","As the Biden administration pulls out all the stops to promote passage of its infrastructure proposals by Congress, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm made a late-night cable news appearance to sell parts of the plan.In a Sept. 8 appearance on CNN, Granholm was asked by host Don Lemon about negotiations between the administration and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who is a pivotal vote on almost every piece of legislation in an evenly divided Senate. Manchin is widely considered the Senate’s most moderate Democrat, and his state backed Donald Trump over Joe Biden by a wide margin in both 2016 and 2020.In her CNN appearance, Granholm touted clean-energy proposals that could boost the economy in West Virginia, a state that has long been reliant on the coal industry and is now experiencing pressure to shift its economy toward clean energy.""West Virginia University just came out with a study that showed that there will be almost 20,000 jobs created in clean energy in West Virginia if these bills are passed, if the ‘Build Back Better’ agenda is passed,"" Granholm said. (""Build Back Better"" is one of the branding labels used by Biden to describe his agenda during the 2020 campaign.)We can’t verify a prediction of future job growth, but we can verify whether Granholm correctly cited the WVU study in question. Does it say that Biden’s agenda could bring 20,000 jobs to West Virginia? Basically, yes — but there are some caveats.The report Granholm was referring to was written by researchers at West Virginia University’s Center for Energy and Sustainable Development, her office confirmed to Politifact West Virginia.In August 2021, the center published ""West Virginia’s Energy Future: Build Back Better,"" an analysis of proposed clean-energy legislation as well as Biden’s American Jobs Plan.The researchers looked at Biden’s call for a ""path to achieving 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035"" as well as a 10-year extension of clean-energy tax incentives.Their modeling shows that this would add 3,508 full-time jobs to the West Virginia economy and produce $20.9 billion of investment in new power plants in the state by 2040.The remaining jobs to reach 20,000 would come from a bill sponsored by Manchin, the American Jobs in Energy Manufacturing Act. This measure proposes $8 billion in tax credits and carves out specific credits for communities affected by the decline of the coal industry.Manchin’s proposal, the researchers projected, would create between 12,550 and 16,750 jobs in clean-energy manufacturing as well as indirect spending from the investment. The tax credits are estimated to generate $1.7 billion of investment in energy manufacturing in West Virginia towns where coal plants or coal mines used to be.Featured Fact-checkInstagram postsstated on January 23, 2023 in social media posts on January 23, 2023Electrically charged stones discovered in Congo.By Loreben Tuquero • January 26, 2023The researchers say the two proposals taken together are the type of federal reinvestment necessary to ensure West Virginia’s role in the renewable-energy economy.   ""Sen. Manchin’s proposal is sort of the detailed legislative proposal for what Biden has put in the American Jobs Plan,"" said Tim Cronin, energy fellow at the center and one of the authors of the report. ""And then he got a portion of it into the bipartisan package that the Senate already passed. Now they're looking at getting the balance of it into"" an even larger spending measure known as the reconciliation bill, he said.Taken together, the 3,508 projected jobs from the Biden plan plus 16,750 projected jobs from the Manchin proposal would slightly surpass the 20,000 figure cited by Granholm.""I think that’s pretty close to hitting the nail on the head,"" Cronin said of Granholm’s claim.But there are a few important caveats.First, getting to 20,000 requires using the top figure in the range provided for Manchin’s bill. If the figure at the lower end of this range is used instead, the number of jobs would be about 16,000, about 20% lower than what Granholm cited.Second, the researchers projected that between 9,300 and 12,400 jobs gained — a majority of the total —  would be created ""indirectly"" from the manufacturing investment. This means they would stem from economic activity that flowed from the manufacturing investments. By this logic, workers at an industrial facility created by the bill would spend money at the local grocery store, go out to dinner, see movies and more. But economic development experts warn that indirect job creation is hard to measure and may not materialize. And these jobs are not ""in clean energy"" per se, as Granholm indicated on CNN.Finally, it’s important to note that these are proposals, and thus are not guaranteed to make it into law. In fact, as Granholm was appearing on CNN, Democrats faced major challenges in unifying the party’s moderate and progressive wings and members of the House and Senate behind the various pieces of legislation.Our rulingGranholm said, ""West Virginia University just came out with a study that showed that there will be almost 20,000 jobs created in clean energy in West Virginia if (President Joe Biden’s) agenda is passed.""An analysis by WVU researchers did project that a combination of the Biden and Manchin proposals would create up to 20,000 jobs if enacted. One of the study’s authors characterized Granholm’s recap of the report’s finding as fair.However, Granholm use of the word ""will"" suggests greater certainty than is warranted. She also used the top figure from a range of possible job gains, and a majority of these gains would come from indirect economic activity that can be hard to predict and would not be specifically in clean-energy manufacturing.We rate this claim Half True.",Jennifer Granholm,"September 21, 2021",half-true
174,Laura Schulte,“President Biden has created more jobs in his first 7 months than any POTUS in history.”,"In recent months, many people have returned to work, but the pace of new jobs hasn’t quite matched expectations as the delta variant has sent hospitals reeling with new cases. So, the performance of the economy has been closely watched.U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Milwaukee on Sept. 3, 2021 took to Twitter to credit President Joe Biden with a historic upturn in the number of new jobs:""President Biden has created more jobs in his first 7 months than any POTUS in history. During a pandemic. And an economic downturn. President Biden’s leadership is helping America bounce back and our economy recover. Democrats will continue moving us forward."" For the purpose of this fact-check, we’re going to focus on the first part of that tweet -- that Biden has created more jobs than any other president in his first seven months in office. Is it true? And should Biden get the credit -- as Moore frames it -- for that increase.Steep increase in jobs because of reopening businesses, vaccines When asked for backup for the claim, Moore’s staff sent us two links: the Sept. 3, 2021 economic update from the Joint Economic Committee, issued the day of Moore’s tweet, and data compiled by Federal Reserve Economic Data, which pulls its information from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. First, let’s look at how many jobs have been created in 2021, starting in February, the first full month of Biden’s presidency, using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics:February: 536,000 new jobsMarch: 785,000April: 269,000May: 614,000June: 962,000July: 1.1 millionAugust (latest month available): 235,000That all adds up to about 4.5 million net new jobs added since Biden was sworn in. And that number is higher than any other president since the end of World War II, said Sophia Koropeckyj, managing director for Moody’s Analytics. Here’s a breakdown of job growth (or loss) for the first seven months for those presidents, with the year their terms began: Joe Biden, 2021: gain of 4,454,000Jimmy Carter, 1977: 2,385,000Richard Nixon, 1969: 1,569,000Bill Clinton, 1993: 1,412,000Featured Fact-checkJoe Bidenstated on January 12, 2023 in remarks at the White House“Take-home pay for workers is going up.”By Louis Jacobson • January 13, 2023Donald Trump, 2017: 1,312,000Lyndon B.

In short, experts say too much credit -- and blame -- goes to presidents, governors and mayors for things out of their control.""The increase in jobs is explained by the reopening of businesses and government and schools following shutdowns in 2020 due to the pandemic,"" said Koropeckyj of Moody’s. ""Favorable fiscal policies have helped.""To be sure, Biden did sign the American Rescue Act, in March 2021, a massive stimulus plan that provided checks to all Americans, extended unemployment and expanded child tax credits.But much of the money meant to help states and businesses is still being distributed, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, so it’s hard to judge what impact that spending has had on the overall economy and jobs. In any case, the job growth began before Biden took office.There had been monthly increases from May through November of 2020, followed by a drop in December 2020, then an increase of 233,000 jobs in January 2021. That’s evidence the economy was getting back on track before Biden did anything.Presidents -- and other top officials --  love to measure their success by the success of the economy. But experts have long cautioned that though presidents hold a powerful position, they don’t really dictate the economy. For instance, Biden inherited an economy that was beginning to recover from the coronavirus pandemic and with vaccinations about to roll out for millions of Americans. With more people vaccinated and able to move about more freely, more money was being spent. That increased demand and the need for workers. And with vaccinations available, more went back to work.In short, how you do as president depends a lot on where you start.When you take office at the bottom of a recession with high unemployment numbers, you ""achieve"" a lot of growth as the economy heals, according to a Jan. 17, 2017 article in the New York Times. When you take office with a low level of unemployment and more job growth, there is often nowhere to go but down. Our rating Moore claimed that Biden has ""created more jobs in his first 7 months than any POTUS in history."" As is typical with such claims, Moore is on target with the numbers -- though, we’d note the increase in jobs began before Biden took office -- but gives too much credit to Biden for his role in something that is largely out of his control.Our definition for Half True is: ""The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.That fits here.  window.gciAnalyticsUAID = 'PMJS-TEALIUM-COBRAND';window.gciAnalyticsLoadEvents = false;window.gciAnalytics.view({    'event-type': 'pageview',    'content-type': 'interactives',    'content-ssts-section': 'news',    'content-ssts-subsection': 'news:politics',    'content-ssts-topic': 'news:politics:politifactwisconsin',    'content-ssts-subtopic': ' news:politics:politifactwisconsin'});",Gwen Moore,"September 21, 2021",half-true

(Ojeda did not respond to inquiries for this article by email and phone.)U.S. spending in Afghanistan The $2 trillion figure is close to the headline number from a widely reported study by the Costs of War project, an effort headquartered at Brown University.The study found that the U.S. spent $2.3 trillion in the region since the post-9/11 military campaign in 2001 and in 2021But there’s an important caveat, said Heidi Peltier, a contributor to the Costs of War project and a political scientist at Boston University: The figure includes more than just money spent on military equipment and training.""This is a more inclusive estimate than just the ‘war budget,’"" Peltier said. The ""war budget,"" officially known as the budget for ""overseas contingency operations,"" was just over $1 trillion in Afghanistan during that period, she said. ""Once you add veterans’ costs, interest costs, and other increased (Pentagon) expenses, the full cost of the war in Afghanistan surpasses $2 trillion,"" Peltier said.The total figure for spending will grow over time, since the $2.3 trillion amount does not include costs for the future care of veterans.Meanwhile, the Pentagon’s accounting of 20 years of spending in Afghanistan also undercuts the figure Ojeda tweeted.Featured Fact-checkInstagram postsstated on January 26, 2023 in a videoThe amount the U.S. has spent in Ukraine is “double the U.S. expenditure for its own war in Afghanistan.”By Jeff Cercone • January 27, 2023The Defense Department spent more than $1.6 trillion between 2001 and March 2021, said Christopher Sherwood, a public affairs specialist with the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Sherwood said these funds were spent in a variety of areas, including war operational costs, troop support, and transportation. But even that figure overshoots the cost to specifically ""train and equip the Afghan military,"" as Ojeda put it.According to the Costs of War project, the Pentagon spent just over $83 billion within the last two decades specifically to support Afghan military and security forcesIn recent years, the amount has been lower than it was in the earlier years of the conflict: The U.S. has spent between $3 billion and $5 billion a year to support Afghan troops in the region, said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.""We did not spend $2 trillion to train and equip the Afghan military,"" Harrison said. ""The cost of training and equipping the Afghan’s is a relatively small subset of the total cost.

But he later updated it, saying that social media companies had ""censored this post"" and that ""fact-checkers have disputed the exact dollar amount of equipment left in Afghanistan."" Hudson acknowledged that some of his numbers might be off, but said he wanted to emphasize the poor execution of the withdrawal. The claim comparing the Taliban’s Black Hawk arsenal to the rest of the world appears to have originated with Congressman Jim Banks, a Republican from Indiana. Banks cited the same statistic in a press conference on Aug. 25. It’s unclear whether the U.S. military left as many as 33 usable Black Hawks behind in Afghanistan. But even if the Taliban has just one, which reports seem to indicate, the claim that the Taliban has more helicopters than ""85%"" has factual basis.Black Hawks in AfghanistanThe U.S. military did have 33 operational Black Hawks in Afghanistan as of June 30, according to a report by the U.S. Department of Defense. (They’re also known as UH-60 helicopters)However, as PolitiFact previously reported and as Banks’ office acknowledged, it's unclear how many of the Black Hawks are now in the hands of the Taliban. Media outlets such as the BBC, NPR and the Washington Post have hesitated to report a specific number of Black Hawks under Taliban control. Meanwhile, one blog run by independent military analysts reports the Taliban seized 18 Black Hawks but that only six are operable.It’s also unclear whether the Taliban has the ability to effectively operate Black Hawk helicopters for warfare. Bradley Bowman, a former Black Hawk pilot in the Army, told NPR that learning to pilot Black Hawks is ""not something that you can do in a week or a month.""

He cited a page on Black Hawk-builder Lockheed Martin’s website, which says the company supplies the helicopters to 29 countries in the world. PolitiFact NC called and emailed a spokesperson for Lockheed Martin to see if the company’s website is up to date, but didn’t receive a response. So let’s move forward with the information available and do some math.If there are 195 countries in the world and 29 have Black Hawks, that means 166 of them don’t — which comes out to 85%. That means, if the Taliban has taken even one Black Hawk, they would have more Black Hawks than 85% of the world.And it appears they do.

178,Lauren White,“It is a result of the $300 per month that working parents are now receiving for their young children that we have reduced childhood poverty in the United States by 50%.”,"Sen. Bernie Sanders I-Vt., said on an August tour to Republican-led states where he pitched the Senate’s $3.5 trillion budget plan that the American Rescue Plan cut U.S. childhood poverty in half. One of the stops where he said this was in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Sunday, Aug. 29. ""It is a result of the $300 per month that working parents are now receiving for their young children that we have reduced childhood poverty in the United States by 50%,"" Sanders said.On Feb. 23, before the American Rescue Plan was enacted, President Biden made the same claim, saying the plan’s increased child tax credit would cut childhood poverty in half if the law passed. He, since, has repeated the assertion. The American Rescue Plan increased the Child Tax Credit from $2,000 to $3,200 and $3,600 for children under six, or $300 a month. The plan also made more people eligible for the credit which increased the total granted to $4,000 for one qualifying individual and $8,000 total for two or more. Biden’s assertions, repeated by Sanders, are true in one regard: the projected poverty rate for 2021 would cut the rate by more than one-half. But we haven’t been through the year to see whether or not the projection will be true.A U.S. Census Bureau report released Sept. 14 showed the poverty rate for Americans under the age of 18 and younger was 16.1 percent in 2020. That is up from the Census Bureau report of 14.4 percent in poverty in 2019 but lower than any rate before 2019 since 16 percent in 1976.In-depth reporting for the plan previously done by PolitiFact showed that the prediction was made using a poverty reduction analysis report by Columbia University on Jan. 14, 2021. The Columbia report predicted that the number of people under the age of 18 living in poverty would decrease 51.1 percent because of several proposed policy elements including the expanded Child Tax Credit. The analysis did not account for other policy elements that would impact policy rates like an increased minimum wage, child care assistance and rental assistance. Featured Fact-checkJoe Bidenstated on February 7, 2023 in his State of the Union address""Studies show that children who go to preschool are nearly 50% more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a two- or four-year degree, no matter their background they came from.""By Louis Jacobson • February 10, 2023According to a July 28 report from The Urban Institute, a nonprofit research organization, the projected poverty rate for children in 2021 is 5.6%. Additionally, the report said that federal stimulus checks in general have a larger antipoverty impact than unemployment insurance or means-based benefits.""If all other programs were in place but the stimulus checks had not been paid, we project 12.4 million more people would be in poverty in 2021,"" the report said. During the week of March 14, 2020, the number of Iowa families who requested food and financial assistance increased by over 1,000 to 4,672. The same relative week a year before, 3,173 had sought the assistance. By the week of April 4, 2020, 7,342 families had requested assistance. Alex Carfrae, Iowa Department of Human Services’ public information officer, said that, while the American Rescue Plan is providing direct financial relief to Iowa families, it is too early to know whether or not child poverty in Iowa has dropped since the plan became law. In 2019, 12.8% of children in Iowa were experiencing poverty, That was down from 13.5% from the previous year. Carfrae said the Department of Human Services does not keep track of poverty numbers in the state but rather through program utilization. ""Many of the assistance programs that the DHS administers saw dramatic shifts in utilization as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, making any analysis based on DHS programs or enrollment data challenging,"" Carfrae said. Our rulingSanders was specific in his Cedar Rapids statement, that the $300 monthly payment working parents receive has reduced U.S. childhood poverty 50%. He stated that as fact, not a projection. Researchers from Columbia University and the Urban Institute project that childhood poverty in the U.S. will fall this year by more than one half, from 16.1% in 2020.

180,Sasha Hupka,"“California is moving folks out of encampments, into safe housing and getting them the mental health services they need.”","Caltrans officials clearing a Berkeley homeless encampment last month were joined by a surprise guest: Gov. Gavin Newsom, who personally spoke with the workers about their efforts to move unhoused people into shelters and was photographed at the site moving items.Ninety minutes later, the photos were posted on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, along with a statement:""California is moving folks out of encampments, into safe housing and getting them the mental health services they need. The conditions at this site in Berkeley are unacceptable and unsafe. Homelessness can be solved and the #CAcomeback Plan puts us on that path.""Some Californians immediately expressed their displeasure online, calling the photos ""cruel"" and ""propaganda.""Optics aside, there was another issue: Several local homeless advocates said not everyone from the site, known as the Seabreeze encampment, was placed into safe housing, as the tweet suggests.While Newsom was taking pictures, advocates claimed many former residents of the encampment were left in limbo, desperately seeking new places to live.With the local controversy well underway and the gubernatorial recall days away, we set out on a fact check.The EncampmentThe Seabreeze encampment was located at the intersection of University Avenue and Interstate 80, near the Berkeley Marina. It was comprised of ""upstairs,"" located in the grassy area between the freeway and Frontage Road, and ""downstairs,"" an area next to the freeway underneath the University Avenue overpass.The site, on land owned by the California Department of Transportation, or Caltrans, was a long-standing encampment in the community. Some unhoused people had resided there for years, including Christopher ""Chaos"" Lilley, who said he lived at the site since March 2018.It was also one of the largest encampments in the city, with an estimated 80 people at the time of the sweep, according to figures published by Berkeleyside.A local nonprofit, Where Do We Go Berkeley, was involved in managing the tent community. The group assists residents of encampments in the Interstate 80 corridor in the East Bay.During most of the COVID-19 pandemic, Caltrans halted encampment clear-outs, an effort to prevent the spread of the virus and ensure residents remained near their medical service providers. But at the start of the summer, officials resumed sweeps.Newsom joined officials for the clean-out of the ""downstairs"" portion of the encampment on Aug. 9. The ""upstairs"" was cleared the following week.The sweep was prompted by deteriorating conditions, said Caltrans spokesperson Matt Rocco. He said a large fire broke out at the camp several weeks before and that it ""presented potentially hazardous conditions for the traveling public.""""Electrical boxes for lighting on the quad area are continuously being broken into and tapped for power sources, along with constant fires from unsafe heating equipment,"" he added.Shelter Or The StreetsAt the ""downstairs"" portion, signs notifying residents of the encampment’s pending closure appeared roughly 10 days before the clearing.California cities generally give residents at least 72 hours notice of pending sweeps, and Caltrans must give notice under the terms of a $5.5 million settlement of a class-action lawsuit in early 2020.Officials also cannot arrest people for sleeping on the street without first offering them shelter, the result of a 2018 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Martin v. Boise.But they aren’t required to give them social services such as permanent housing or health care following the evictions, said Heather Freinkel and Danny Homer, managing attorneys at the Alameda County Homeless Action Center.""While Martin v. Boise prohibits criminal action against homeless people when no alternative shelter is offered or available, that only applies to criminalization,"" Freinkel said. ""Cities can still come in and throw people's property in a dumpster and force them to leave, as long as they don't arrest or charge anyone.""Ian Cordova Morales, president of Where Do We Go Berkeley, said the signs posted at the camp encouraged residents to call 211, Alameda County’s housing and health services hotline, to access housing services.He noted the signs were only posted in English, even though several residents only spoke Spanish. Additionally, he said the outreach worker in charge of helping people enter Berkeley’s shelter system was not initially present at the sweep.""He arrived an hour late,"" Morales said. ""So at the time of the sweep, when people were getting kicked out of the area, there was nobody there to offer them services. They were all gone by the time he showed up.""The city of Berkeley assisted with on-the-ground outreach efforts prior to the sweep, said spokesperson Matthai Chakko. He said workers visited the encampment at least once per week in May and June, and held an event to provide information about housing options in late June.Those options came with offers for transportation, he added.""Our commitment to people who are unhoused means that the City, Alameda County, and nonprofit partners we fund continue to provide outreach and shelter and service offers to as many people as possible who are unhoused,"" Chakko said. ""We strive to serve all within the constraints of our resources.""Featured Fact-checkPublic Interest Legal Foundationstated on January 18, 2023 in a reportIn California, there were “10 million mail ballots unaccounted for” in the November midterm election.By Jeff Cercone • January 26, 2023For the ""downstairs"" sweep, Morales said unhoused residents ultimately had three options: go to the Grayson Shelter, try to secure a spot in Project Roomkey or refuse services entirely and stay on the streets.The Grayson Shelter, formerly known as the Horizon Transitional Shelter, opened in July and can temporarily house 50 people. It is a 24-hour shelter, which Morales said makes it a better option than what was previously available in Berkeley. But he said it’s little more than a warehouse with tents.""The general vibe of the place freaks people out a little bit because it's got a weird set up,"" Morales said. ""People were getting FEMA vibes from it. And unhoused people are generally a little bit paranoid about FEMA.""Project Roomkey, a program partially funded by the state, was started by the Newsom administration in March 2020, has provided temporary shelter for tens of thousands of homeless Californians in hotel and motel rooms since the start of the pandemic. Supporters say the program prevented major outbreaks of the virus in the homeless community and connects residents with housing and social services. They say the rooms offer simple but profound benefits — clean water, the chance to take a shower and dignity. Morales said most unhoused residents of the Seabreeze encampment were open to joining the Roomkey program. But by the time of the sweep, finding rooms was a struggle.Lilley, the unhoused resident who had lived at the tent community for three years, is currently participating in Roomkey. He said it took five days after the sweep to secure his room. In the meantime, he added, he was forced to find new places to sleep on the street.Even though he now has a room, Lilley said the program has been far from ideal.""We do not get a key to our own rooms,"" he said. ""If we are not in by 11 p.m. we can't come till 6 a.m., although there are two security guards in the parking lot 24 hours per day.""He added that security guards search residents’ backpacks before they are allowed to enter the hotel and that each person is only allowed to have a certain number of items in their room.""It's very stressful,"" Lilley said.Unhoused people often encounter unexpected barriers to entering temporary housing, Homer, of the Homeless Action Center, said. In most places, animals are not allowed in shelters and storage space is not available for bikes, carts and other belongings. Sometimes, shelters and other housing options are in unfamiliar areas.""As an analogy, if someone came to my apartment and said, ‘Hey, we have to bulldoze this building, pack a backpack and come with me to another temporary apartment sight unseen,’ I'd be hesitant too,"" Homer said. ""So even though it might seem like a good offer, I can understand people being tentative, suspicious and some refusing a room or shelter bed.""The ImpactIt’s unclear where everyone from the ""downstairs"" of the Seabreeze encampment is currently located.Rocco of Caltrans said that local agencies reported 15 clients in the encampment in June. Of those 15 people, he said 11 were placed into temporary or permanent housing. Four declined services and remain unhoused.But other sources found more people remained unsheltered.Berkeleyside reported that 35 people lived in the camp, based on data from Where Do We Go Berkeley. At least 10 are still on the streets, at least 10 have some sort of shelter and one is deceased. It’s unclear where the others are located.Morales said he and others with Where Do We Go Berkeley were ""upset"" by the statement from the governor’s office.""The biggest problem that I had with it was [Newsom] putting out this message that everything is fine and that everything went great and they cleaned and the people got housing when our whole group, our message and what I've been working on for the last two years, is letting people know that things are not fine,"" Morales said. ""They are as far from fine as they could be.""Lilley said he knows at least five people who are still unsheltered. He called the statement from the governor’s office ""an absolute lie.""""Instead of looking like he was going through our possessions and destroying what little we had … he could have had a conversation with us himself to show his concern,"" Lilley said. ""But instead he focused on garbage and cleaning it up.""Rocco confirmed that Newsom did not speak with any unhoused people while he was at the encampment sweep.""Gov. Newsom arrived around 10 a.m., and by that time, there were no people experiencing homelessness present at the site,"" Rocco said.He added that Newsom is ""dedicated to providing proper care to those struggling the most and who’ve found themselves homeless due to mental health and addiction struggles.""In the weeks since the ""downstairs"" sweep, Newsom has appeared at several other encampment clear-outs and clean-ups, including one in San Francisco at the end of last month.Our RatingA statement from the governor’s office claimed that California is providing unhoused people with services and shelter. It was posted on social media alongside photos of Newsom assisting with an encampment sweep.While the post gives the impression that all or most people at the encampment received housing, that’s only partially true. At least four people declined the offer of housing and remained unsheltered, according to state officials. A local advocacy group believes more than twice as many remain on the streets.People who did accept services largely ended up in temporary housing programs, but some spent days after the sweep on the streets while sorting through the logistics of being placed in the Grayson Shelter or Project Roomkey. The social media post ignores this important context.Perhaps most importantly, the story behind this sweep speaks to the broader challenges of accessing housing and services in California. Newsom and other state officials have worked to create new options for unhoused people, such as Project Roomkey, and Newsom’s California Comeback Plan invests $12 billion into tackling homelessness.However, temporary housing often comes with barriers to entry that are insurmountable to unhoused people who have disabilities, are struggling with addiction or are experiencing mental illnesses. Additionally, the California Comeback Plan was just signed this summer, so it’s too early to tell how much of an impact new funding will have.In short, while California officials are working to find solutions to homelessness, they are still a long way from housing and providing services to the state’s vast homeless population. While some Berkeley encampment residents received housing, we found that several remain on the streets or in temporary residences with high barriers to entry.

""They’ve been warning us the extreme weather would get more extreme over the decade, and we’re living it in real time now.""A Wall Street Journal columnist wrote that when it comes to hurricanes, too much is made of the climate change effect. ""Atlantic hurricanes are not becoming more frequent,"" columnist Bjorn Lomborg wrote Sept. 3. ""In fact, the frequency of hurricanes making landfall in the continental U.S. has declined slightly since 1900.""Lomborg continued.""There aren’t more powerful hurricanes either. The frequency of Category 3 and above hurricanes making landfall since 1900 is also trending slightly down,"" he wrote.Lomborg is a Danish political scientist and president of Copenhagen Consensus Center, a Danish think tank. He has long questioned conventional wisdom on climate change, and his column said improving infrastructure would do more to save lives and property than cutting carbon emissions.The idea that the U.S. is seeing fewer hurricanes, and fewer powerful ones as well, runs counter to the thrust of many news articles. It's fair to say that hurricanes sit in one of the knottier corners of climate change where the trends and underlying forces are tough to untangle. But Lomborg overstates the data.Downward trend vs. no trend in frequencyLomborg cites a 2018 article in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society that had a chart showing a slight decline in the yearly number of hurricanes that hit the U.S.Chart of hurricanes making landfall in the U.S. since 1900 (© American Meteorological Society. Used with permission.)Hurricane activity swings up and down, and the authors use a statistical device to create an overall trend line — the dotted line in the chart.""I simply show the data of what actually has happened, as documented in the best, peer-reviewed papers, to contrast what many believe from listening to a media filled with hurricane reporting,"" Lomborg told us.Lomborg’s data, though, is more ambiguous than first appears. The study’s authors note that their dotted line is not statistically significant. One of the authors, Roger Pielke Jr., a political scientist in the University of Colorado’s environmental studies program, affirmed Lomborg’s claim about a slight decline. But he also said the latest U.N. report found ""no trend in the frequency of U.S. landfall events.""A finding of ""no trend"" is not the same as finding a downward trend.The decrease was not meaningful, said Christopher Landsea, National Hurricane Center’s chief of Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch. Researchers in this field emphasize that looking back to 1900, there is no discernable trend, up or down.Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on January 17, 2023 in an Instagram postGreta Thunberg staged an arrest in Germany.By Ciara O'Rourke • January 19, 2023""The main takeaway is that there's been no increase in U.S. hurricane numbers,"" Landsea said.Lomborg relies on the same Meteorological Society article to say that the frequency of strong hurricanes — those rated Category 3 or higher — is trending slightly down. But again, the authors of that article said the trend wasn’t statistically significant.With his focus on the havoc wreaked by hurricanes, Lomborg looked only at storms that made landfall in the U.S. But that approach omits a lot of storms from the study of climate change and tropical cyclones.""One has to remember that only about 12% of all hurricanes occur in the Atlantic and only about a third of those make landfall in the U.S., so he is talking about roughly 4% of all hurricanes,"" said Kerry Emanuel, professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.The murky world of hurricane dataThe interplay of all the forces that produce hurricanes are complicated. There are a host of data problems in the historic record, which Lombard acknowledged. The further back you go, the greater the chance that some hurricanes went uncounted, even the ones that hit land. There’s a long-term naturally occurring fluctuation in the waters of the Atlantic that might affect the number of hurricanes — although researchers vigorously debate its role. Many, though not all, researchers believe that from 1960 to 1980, aerosol pollutants likely counteracted global warming by reducing the sunlight that warmed the ocean. This would mask the impact of greenhouse gases on hurricane trends. When clean air legislation removed those pollutants, greenhouse warming came to the fore.The U.N.’s International Panel on Climate Change wrote in its latest report that there has been an ""observed increase in Atlantic hurricane activity since the 1970s."" The report also said that there’s no consensus on what lies behind that.Fewer but stronger stormsLomborg dismissed the idea that hurricane patterns have changed in the course of a century. But researchers looking at more recent periods, and more than just storms that hit the U.S., have the advantage of much more complete data than is available in the historic record. A 2019 paper concluded that human-driven climate change likely made Atlantic hurricanes stronger. The authors analyzed changes in wind speed for storms between 1982 and 2009 and found ""significant increases in tropical cyclone intensification rates in the Atlantic basin that are highly unusual."" They said naturally occurring factors didn’t fully explain the shift.To add to the complexity, climate change pushes hurricane trends both up and down.Greenhouse gases have raised ocean temperatures. By itself, that would lead to more hurricanes. But James Kossin, a senior scientist with the analytics group The Climate Service and a researcher at the University of Wisconsin notes that the same greenhouse gas warming tends to stabilize the atmosphere.""It suppresses the tropical thunderstorms that would ultimately strengthen to form tropical depressions and then tropical storms and hurricanes,"" Kossin said. ""They can't get off the ground, so to speak.""Many models predict climate change will bring fewer hurricanes, which leads Kossin to minimize the importance of Lomborg’s argument.""Concentrating on the continental U.S. landfall frequency record has become a bit of a cottage industry for anyone who wants to claim that hurricanes are not linked to climate change,"" Kossin said. ""We're not sure that there will be more storms that form, and there may even be fewer that form, but when they do form, they are more likely to be very dangerous: stronger winds, higher storm surge, more rain and freshwater flooding, slower moving and more likely to stall.""Our rulingLomborg said that the frequency and strength of hurricanes hitting the U.S. had declined slightly since 1900. The small shift in some of Lomborg’s sources doesn’t amount to a statistically significant change over the past 120 years. Researchers broadly agree that given all the problems with the historic data, there is no discernable trend either way.Studies of Atlantic storms since 1980, using more robust data, find that the hurricanes that form there tend to be stronger than in the past. Human-driven climate change might play a role, although the science is unsettled.Lomborg focused on a limited number of hurricanes and pushed the data beyond what the research supports.

The headline states:""New Israeli Study Finds Fully Vaccinated People are at ""Greater Risk of Hospitalization"" and 13 TIMES MORE LIKELY to Catch Covid-19 Than Those Who Have Recovered and Have Natural Immunity.""The headline was shared in an Instagram post that was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)The headline accurately reflects some of the study’s findings but ignores the study’s limitations, including that only one vaccine was tested, and that other studies have found that COVID-19 poses much greater danger to people who have not been vaccinated.Without that context, the headline leaves the impression that it’s safer to get COVID-19 and hope to recover than to try to avoid it by getting vaccinated. That’s not true.The studyThe study is what is known as a preprint, meaning it has not yet been vetted by experts. It was posted Aug. 25 on medRxiv.com, which added this note: ""This article is a preprint and has not been peer-reviewed. It reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice.""The study was led by researchers at the Maccabi Research & Innovation Center at Maccabi Healthcare Services in Tel Aviv. They reviewed the records of patients in the Maccabi health system — 674,000 patients who were fully vaccinated and 105,000 who had been infected. Among the 105,000 who had been infected, 63,000 were unvaccinated and 42,000 had received one Pfizer dose three months after recovery.The researchers said the study is ""the largest real-world observational study comparing natural immunity"" gained from infection by the coronavirus, with immunity provided by the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. They looked at patient records from June through August 2021, when the delta variant was dominant in Israel.They found:People who received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine in January or February 2021 were 13 times more likely to get a breakthrough infection with the delta variant than unvaccinated people who had COVID-19 during the same period were to be reinfected. Over a longer period of time — with infection occurring anytime from March 2020 to February 2021, when different variants were dominant in Israel — fully vaccinated people in the study were six times more likely to become infected and seven times more likely to experience ""symptomatic disease"" than unvaccinated people in the study.Featured Fact-checkScott Adamsstated on January 23, 2023 in an Instagram postPeople not vaccinated against COVID-19 “came out the best.""By Tom Kertscher • January 26, 2023The study ""demonstrated that natural immunity affords longer lasting and stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization due to the delta variant,"" compared with the Pfizer two-dose vaccine-induced immunity, although previously infected people gained additional protection with a single dose of the vaccine.Caution in interpreting the findingsThe study has been well received by some experts as an indicator of the strength of natural immunity. But it has limitations, including the fact that it was done through record reviews, which are limited by biases in health care seeking behavior — such as testing, mask wearing and social distancing — that may differ among the groups compared, said Dr. Matthew Laurens of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland.""This type of study design is not as robust as a prospective study that follows individuals forward in time, testing them at regular intervals and collecting data on symptoms systematically,"" he said. ""Prospective studies should be done to determine if these findings can be replicated.Gauging immunity by comparing COVID-19 reinfection rates among the unvaccinated with breakthrough infections among the vaccinated ignores the dangers of contracting COVID-19 in the first place and the protections against severe illness that vaccines provide. As we’ve reported:As of late July, vaccinated people represented a higher percentage of new COVID-19 cases in Israel than those who are unvaccinated. (This is not unexpected, because Israel has a high overall vaccination rate.) But among Israelis who were fully vaccinated and experienced breakthrough infections, the COVID-19 vaccine was 88% effective in preventing the need for hospitalization and 91% effective against severe illness.Israel’s early vaccine campaign, which resulted in more than 60% of its population being fully vaccinated, led to huge reductions in serious cases and deaths in the country.In August, we rated False a claim that it’s safer to be unvaccinated than vaccinated. Studies of the general adult population in the United States show that the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines have an 86% to 89% effectiveness rate against infection, and a 96% effectiveness rate against hospitalization, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Early evidence for the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine also demonstrates effectiveness against COVID-19, but more studies are underway, CDC said.""The suggestion that you might be better off getting infected versus vaccinated does not take into account the inherent risks associated with COVID-19 infection, including death,"" Laurens said. ""Vaccination is the best prevention. This has been clearly shown in multiple prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trials, which are the very highest quality for clinical studies.""Experts told the journal Science that seeking immunity through deliberate infection would put unvaccinated people at significant risk of severe disease and death, or the lingering, significant symptoms of what has been dubbed Long COVID.The Maccabi study shows the benefits of natural immunity, said University of Washington immunologist Marion Pepper, but ""doesn’t take into account what this virus does to the body to get to that point.""  Our rulingA headline widely shared on social media stated: ""New Israeli study finds fully vaccinated people are at ‘greater risk of hospitalization’ and 13 times more likely to catch COVID-19 than those who have recovered and have natural immunity.""The study, which has not been peer reviewed, found that people who had been infected with COVID-19 had greater protection against becoming reinfected with the virus’ delta variant than vaccinated people had against infection.But the headline’s suggestion that people are better off going unvaccinated ignores the fact that peer-reviewed studies repeatedly have found that vaccinated people are more likely to avoid hospitalization or death if they become infected.The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

185,Miriam Valverde,There has been “no question of our credibility from our allies around the world” regarding how the U.S. is withdrawing from Afghanistan.,"Under fire over the plight of Afghans and Americans trying to flee Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, President Joe Biden has defended the U.S. military’s withdrawal and pushed back against assertions that U.S. credibility is damaged.On Aug. 20, a reporter asked Biden: ""What is your message to America’s partners around the world who have criticized not the withdrawal, but the conduct of that withdrawal and made them question America’s credibility on the world stage?"" Biden replied: ""I have seen no question of our credibility from our allies around the world. I've spoken with our NATO allies. … The fact of the matter is I have not seen that. As a matter of fact, the exact opposite I've gotten. The exact opposite thing is we're acting with dispatch. We're committing to what we said we would do.""We can’t fact-check what Biden has seen, but we wondered if his main point is accurate: Is it true that no allies have questioned U.S. credibility in light of the chaos in Afghanistan?Biden’s claim is partly right, but leaves out important details.PolitiFact looked through statements on Afghanistan issued by leaders of NATO members, including those that an expert said contributed most to the International Security Assistance Force mission in the country: Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and France.The current leaders of those four NATO members have not publicly condemned the U.S. response or questioned its credibility. But some members of foreign governments have challenged the U.S. and NATO on the withdrawal and said that outcomes in Afghanistan weakened the West.And a day after Biden’s claim, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, an ardent defender of U.S. interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan, wrote: ""The world is now uncertain of where the West stands because it is so obvious that the decision to withdraw from Afghanistan in this way was driven not by grand strategy but by politics.""The White House press office did not comment on the record for this fact-check.What’s going on in AfghanistanOn-the-ground reporting has shown chaotic scenes in Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, as people try to leave the country, fearing Taliban reprisals against those who worked with allied forces and the U.S.-backed government. The U.S. and other countries have scrambled to arrange evacuation flights on military and commercial planes.The U.S.’ withdrawal came after nearly two decades of war against the Taliban, which ruled in Kabul from 1996 to 2001 and harbored al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, who planned the 9/11 terrorist attacks against the U.S. A coalition of U.S. and allied forces drove out the Taliban in 2001, but the group swiftly regained power in Afghanistan as U.S. troops began withdrawing from the country under the February 2020 agreement between the Taliban and the Trump administration. In this Jan. 15, 2018 photo, the commander of NATO and U.S. forces in Afghanistan, U.S. Army Gen. John W. Nicholson, speaks during a change of command ceremony at Task Force Southwest at Shorab military camp of Helmand province, Afghanistan. (AP) When examining the reaction among allies, the most relevant ones to focus on are the biggest NATO contributors to the mission in Afghanistan, said Teresa Eder, a program associate at the Global Europe Program at the Wilson Center. ""Obviously, we have not heard from prime ministers, chancellors, or presidents openly questioning the way this withdrawal was and is being conducted,"" Eder said.But some members of parliament from governing parties, and not just opposition leaders, have spoken up.The criticism hasn’t been targeted just at the United States. Some criticism has also been aimed at NATO and the West in general. The scope also has varied: Some have criticized the decision to withdraw from Afghanistan, others have condemned the aftermath, and others have broadly said the outcome in Afghanistan was a failure and proposed re-examining their own approaches to foreign policy. In their criticism, some have referenced their own governments’ accountability.Eder said there is ""some weight"" to comments from Norbert Röttgen, chairman of the foreign affairs committee in Germany’s national parliament and a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling party.""I say this with a heavy heart and with horror over what is happening, but the early withdrawal was a serious and far-reaching miscalculation by the current administration,"" said Röttgen, according to Politico. ""This does fundamental damage to the political and moral credibility of the West.""On Aug. 15, the day the Afghan president fled the country and Taliban fighters entered Kabul, Röttgen tweeted in German: ""Today is an immeasurable catastrophe. It is the result of the fatal wrong decision by the U.S. to rush to leave Afghanistan & our inactivity following this decision. A failure of the West with dramatic consequences for (Afghanistan) & our credibility.""On Aug. 18, Röttgen also tweeted that German and European Union foreign policy can no longer consist of ""just trailing behind the Americans.""Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chair of the U.K. Parliament’s foreign affairs committee, tweeted: ""Afghanistan is the biggest foreign policy disaster since Suez. We need to think again about how we handle friends, who matters and how we defend our interests. In Kabul we’ve failed our friends and ourselves. We need to think again, fast.""In a speech, Tugendhat also called for ""reinvigorating our European NATO partners to make sure that we are not dependent on a single ally, on the decision of a single leader.""Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the defense committee in the British Parliament, has questioned the sincerity of Biden’s foreign policy messaging.Featured Fact-checkInstagram postsstated on January 26, 2023 in a videoThe amount the U.S. has spent in Ukraine is “double the U.S. expenditure for its own war in Afghanistan.”By Jeff Cercone • January 27, 2023""People are bewildered that after two decades of this big, high-tech power intervening, they are withdrawing and effectively handing the country back to the people we went in to defeat,"" Ellwood told the Washington Post. ""This is the irony. How can you say America is back when we're being defeated by an insurgency armed with no more than (rocket-propelled grenades), land mines and AK-47s?""Latvia’s defense minister, Artis Pabriks, said in a radio interview that ""this kind of troop withdrawal caused chaos,"" and that ""unfortunately, the West, and Europe in particular, are showing they are weaker globally,"" the Post reported.Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, called the developments a ""catastrophe for the Afghan people, for the Western values and credibility and for the developing of international relations.""Among current leaders of NATO countries, Czech President Milos Zeman took direct aim at the U.S. ""I think that by leaving Afghanistan, the Americans have lost the prestige of a global leader and NATO itself has raised doubts about the legitimacy of its existence,"" Zeman said, according to a Times of India report that cited Czech media.Public statements from Merkel, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italy’s prime minister Mario Draghi have emphasized the need to evacuate from Afghanistan their citizens and Afghans who have helped the allied mission, as well as a commitment to the protection of human rights and freedoms in Afghanistan.After the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan, Merkel said the developments were ""bitter, dramatic and appalling, especially for the people in Afghanistan."" She also praised international cooperation on evacuations and said that the ""allies and of course the Federal Armed Forces along with numerous civilian organisations had accomplished an enormous amount.""International reaction in contextForeign policy experts told us that it’s important to put some of the criticism in context. There may be a political agenda behind them, or an effort to protect a leader’s legacy, said Sara Bjerg Moller, an assistant professor at the School of Diplomacy and International Relations at Seton Hall University.In Germany, for example, ruling-party leader Armin Laschet, who called the allied withdrawal a ""debacle,"" is running in a close election to succeed Merkel as chancellor, Moller noted.In Europe, ""politicians are having to answer to their own publics about the role their governments played in Afghanistan over the years,"" Moller said, ""as well as trying to head off criticism regarding ​challenges they are facing getting their own people and ​local partners out by shifting attention and blaming Washington.""Zeman’s comments are primarily geared toward a domestic audience and ""have no larger consequences for NATO or the United States,"" Eder said. Zeman, who is head of state, but not head of government, is known for his Russian-friendly stance, experts said.NATO allies have known about the U.S. withdrawal, and many got their own forces out in advance, precisely because they knew Biden's timetable, Moller said.""Telling the media now they are shaken by Biden's withdrawal timetable and would have preferred to maintain the status quo — which wasn't a status quo — is hypocrisy at best and a bald face lie, at worst,"" Moller said.Some members of foreign governments who are speaking out may be using the moment to push for concessions from the United States in future policy discussions, said Joshua Shifrinson, an associate professor of international relations at Boston University.""The fact that we haven’t seen the castigation of U.S. credibility in an overt, dramatic way is a more telling indicator,"" said Shifrinson.Where does U.S. credibility stand?Experts said that the U.S. withdrawal in Afghanistan and ensuing events aren’t being interpreted as an indicator that the U.S. won’t live up to its commitments to allies, such as collective defense obligations under NATO principles.""I think we can certainly say that we overrated the U.S. planning to withdraw from Afghanistan in an orderly fashion,"" Eder said, ""but I don’t think we can draw any larger conclusions from this and say the United States would not come to the aid of NATO allies in the event of a Russian military attack.""Said Moller: ""I am dubious of the claim that the U.S. departure from Afghanistan has shaken our allies' confidence about U.S. security guarantees elsewhere in the world.""European leaders have emphasized that they want to continue coordinating and working with the United States on evacuations, humanitarian issues and the future stability of the region, Eder said.She said that European leaders also have an interest in waiting to see how things unfold over the next several weeks rather than risking upsetting trans-Atlantic ties on another front.""Some analysts argue that far from diminishing U.S. credibility, the withdrawal from Afghanistan will free up U.S. resources and capabilities that could enhance deterrence vis-à-vis Russia or China,"" Eder said.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Aug. 20 said that ""NATO remains a strong alliance"" and that North America and Europe must continue to stand together.""The unfolding events in Afghanistan do not change this,"" Stoltenberg said. ""The shifting global balance of power, Russia’s aggressive actions, and the rise of China, make it even more important that we keep a strong trans-Atlantic bond.""Our rulingBiden said there has been ""no question of our credibility from our allies around the world"" regarding how the U.S. is withdrawing from Afghanistan.Some foreign officials have challenged the U.S. and NATO on the withdrawal from Afghanistan and how it was executed.

As the situation unfolded, a new Afghan president rose to power, and Twitter suspended two government accounts.Afghanistan’s new presidentAfghanistan’s President Ashraf Ghani fled to the United Arab Emirates as the Taliban closed in on Kabul on Aug. 15, according to CNN. Two days later, Afghanistan’s First Vice President ​​Amrullah Saleh declared himself the ""caretaker,"" or acting, president.""As per the constitution of Afghanistan, in absence, escape, resignation or death of the President the FVP (First Vice President) becomes the caretaker President,"" Saleh tweeted on Aug. 17. While Afghanistan’s Constitution does not include ""escape"" or ""caretaker"" in the English translation, Article 60 allows the first vice president to become president under these circumstances.The Twitter account Saleh used to tweet this is not suspended as of this writing, and neither is Ghani’s. However, there are two other accounts affiliated with Afghanistan’s president and Saleh’s political party that Twitter has suspended. Twitter suspended the accounts @Afghpresident and @AfgGreenTrend as of Aug. 23.In an email with PolitiFact, a spokesperson from Twitter said, ""We’re proactively monitoring accounts affiliated with government organizations, and we may temporarily suspend accounts pending additional information from the account holder that allows us to confirm their identity.""Both of these accounts seem to be legitimate. For example, the Associated Press called @Afghpresident the ""de facto official presidential account"" of Afghanistan in its reporting on the suspension. The Afghanistan Green Trend party used @AfgGreenTrend to update the public following an attack that injured Saleh and killed at least two others in 2019.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 16, 2023 in a photo on Facebook“Every single Republican blocked Ketanji Brown Jackson’s SCOTUS appointment.”By Sara Swann • January 17, 2023The Instagram post implies that Twitter suspended these accounts to legitimize the Taliban as the rulers of Afghanistan, but there is no evidence of this. There is also no evidence that Twitter suspended the accounts to retaliate against Saleh, as some users and outlets have suggested, since Saleh’s account where he declared himself president is still active.The Taliban’s TwitterAs for the Taliban’s accounts, representatives from Facebook and YouTube told the New York Times that they consider the Taliban a terrorist organization and forbid the group from operating on their platforms. However, Twitter has taken a different route when dealing with accounts linked to the Taliban.The Taliban isn’t banned from Twitter, but Twitter’s spokesperson told us they would take action against any content that violates their policies on glorifying violence, abusive behavior, hateful conduct, wishes of harm and gratuitous gore.One Taliban spokesperson, Suhail Shaheen, has over 390,000 followers and recently tweeted that the group welcomes Afghans who have previously worked with the U.S. or the Afghan government’s administration. The Taliban has promised this before, but some Afghans believe they will be executed if the Taliban finds out about their previous work.As the situation in Afghanistan continues to evolve, we’ll have to see whether Twitter will continue to allow the Taliban on their platform or if their accounts break the website’s rules.According to the Washington Post, the Taliban has been careful to avoid suspension as they use social media to spread propaganda and present an image different from when they were last in power. Meanwhile, some on Twitter have asked why the Taliban is permitted on Twitter while former President Donald Trump is not. Twitter permanently suspended Trump for tweets he sent after the riot at the Capitol.Our rulingAn Instagram post claimed that ""Twitter has suspended the account of Afghanistan’s elected President and have allowed the Taliban to keep their accounts.""Twitter has not suspended the accounts of either acting president Amrullah Saleh or his predecessor Ashraf Ghani.The two Twitter accounts @Afghpresident and @AfgGreenTrend are currently suspended.

Guess how much oil the (Keystone XL pipeline) would have carried from Canada? I will give you a hint. It rhymes with 800,000 barrels.""After years of acrimony, Biden used the power of the executive branch to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have transported crude oil from the Canadian province of Alberta to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with another leg stretching to Gulf Coast refineries. From there, refined petroleum products could be sold either in the U.S. or to foreign buyers. Oil experts say the post draws a misleading relationship between Russian imports and the Keystone pipeline project.The facts behind 800,000 barrelsThe most recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that in May, the U.S. imported 844,000 barrels per day of crude oil and petroleum products from Russia.

Some U.S. plants have specialized systems to refine these fuels, and some oil companies have turned to Russia to keep those factories going in the absence of Venezuelan imports.As for the cancelled Keystone XL pipeline, it would have been able to carry up to 830,000 barrels of oil every day.Featured Fact-checkInstagram postsstated on January 23, 2023 in social media posts on January 23, 2023Electrically charged stones discovered in Congo.By Loreben Tuquero • January 26, 2023Could Keystone XL have saved the U.S. from importing from Russia?Experts said that any impact from the Keystone XL pipeline would have been years down the road. Even if all legal obstacles were to disappear, the project would have involved the construction of 1,204 miles of new pipeline in Canada and the United States.This means the pipeline wouldn’t have solved the immediate problem referred to in the Facebook post. ""There is no justification for comparing oil import levels from Russia to the transportation capacity of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, or to suggest that these imports from Russia would have been entirely displaced by crude transported through Keystone XL,"" said Jason Bordoff, founding director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.In addition, ""the Keystone XL pipeline wouldn’t have produced oil — it would have transported oil,"" said Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at the University of California-Berkeley's Haas School of Business.In other words, just because Keystone XL might have been able to carry 800,000-plus barrels a day ""does not mean that production in Canada would have been 800,000 barrels a day higher than today,"" Bordoff said. The pipeline might have simply displaced other types of transportation, such as tanker trucks, that are currently used to carry oil away from Alberta.There’s no guarantee that oil producers in Alberta would have sold that theoretical excess production to the U.S.Finally, the United States produces much of its own oil and could produce more if needed.In 2020, the most recent full year, the U.S. exported 8.51 million barrels a day of petroleum and imported about 7.86 million, marking the first year since at least 1949 that the U.S. was a net annual petroleum exporter, according to the Energy Information Administration. That same year, the United States produced about 18.4 million barrels of petroleum per day, which is more than its daily consumption of 18.1 million barrels a day.Our rulingA Facebook post said the U.S. is ""now importing 800,000 barrels of oil from Russia,"" but that this could have been prevented if the Keystone XL pipeline hadn’t been cancelled.The amount of oil being imported today from Russia has reached a record level of more than 800,000 barrels a day. That does roughly equal the transport capacity of the Keystone XL pipeline — but it’s not as simple as substituting one source for the other. The pipeline would have required years of construction and likely more legal challenges, so it couldn’t have solved today’s demand needs. Even in the future, there would be no certainty that the pipeline could produce a net increase of 800,000 barrels a day, rather than just transporting oil from Canada that is currently being transported some other way. Nor would producers be obligated to sell that entire amount to the U.S.We rate the statement Half True.",Facebook posts,"August 23, 2021",half-true

Biden referred in the interview to ""SIVs,"" the special immigrant visas created in 2009 specifically to keep safe those who had helped the American mission in Afghanistan.""We had already issued several thousand passports to the — the SIVs, the people — the translators when I came into office, before we had negotiated getting out at the end of August,"" Biden said in the Aug. 18 interview.The numbers the White House provided as evidence deal with Biden’s time in office, and they only partly back up Biden’s claim. The administration has issued special immigrant visas at an ever faster pace, and the total is over 5,000 since April. But that figure includes family members of the people who worked with the U.S., and Biden’s comments don’t address an estimated 18,000 Afghan workers whose applications are still pending.SIVs issued so farBetween April and July, the administration issued 5,641 special visas, the White House press office told PolitiFact. Add to that the 789 issued between January and March, and the total on Biden’s watch is 6,430.But Biden talked about ""translators"" — which can be read broadly as the workers covered by the special immigrant visa program — and to nail down those numbers would require data on how many actual workers, as opposed to family members, have received visas.We don’t have firm data on how many of 5,641 are the people who worked with U.S. forces or agencies, but what we do have points to a much lower figure.The latest State Department report for January through March shows 137 visas issued to the Afghan employees — called principal applicants — and 652 issued to their family members. That suggests that a bit under a fifth of the total were visas for the employees.A higher fraction came from State Department spokesman Ned Price, when he briefed reporters on a different group of Afghans in the approval pipeline.Price said that workers were about 700 out of 2,500 applicants who had been approved for entry (but hadn't necessarily received a visa yet).

The administration has increased the embassy staff to move applications forward.

""Should the need rise, hospitals will staff those beds and make them available."" Hospitals are careful to maintain enough capacity for unexpected circumstances and emergencies, Lotter said, but to contain costs, they do not keep rooms staffed or available if they aren’t in use or likely to be needed. Featured Fact-checkScott Adamsstated on January 23, 2023 in an Instagram postPeople not vaccinated against COVID-19 “came out the best.""By Tom Kertscher • January 26, 2023But not all capacity utilization is the same. A heavy load of COVID-19 patients places an unusual strain on hospital capacity.As of Aug. 11, HHS data indicates that nationwide, about 76.4% inpatient beds in the U.S. are in use — and 10.5% of those beds are in use for COVID-19-specific reasons. Nationally, 75.4% of ICU beds in the U.S. are in use, and 22.2% of those beds are in use for COVID-19. In Olszewski’s home state of Florida — a recent COVID-19 hotspot — the numbers are far higher: 90.1% of ICU beds are in use, and nearly half of those are being used for COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, 86.2% of inpatient beds are in use, more than a quarter of them for COVID-19-specific reasons. ""There is no question many Florida hospitals are reaching their max capacity and beyond,"" Lotter said. He referenced Aug. 5 data from his group indicating that 60% of hospitals surveyed in Florida were expecting to face a ""critical staffing shortage in the next seven days,"" which he said would affect capacity. Additionally, 27% of surveyed Florida hospitals expected that they would need to expand into ""non-care areas"" such as conference rooms and cafeterias, to accommodate patients in the next seven days.In areas where COVID-19 patients account for a high percentage of hospitalizations, there are ""implications for everyone who needs care for emergent or non-emergent reasons,"" said Thomas Jordan, a spokesperson for the American Hospital Association.""Caring for COVID-19 patients is resource-intensive, including from a materials perspective — PPE, oxygen, etc. — and also from a space perspective,"" he said. ""COVID-19 patients must be isolated from non-COVID-19 patients by either placing them in the same units as other COVID patients or in single occupancy rooms. This makes it more difficult for hospitals to have space for all other non-COVID patients."" Jordan also said caring for COVID-19 patients requires ""significant staff resources,"" and noted that at this point in the pandemic ""our doctors, nurses and other staff are exhausted.""In some cases, Jordan noted, hospitals have had to stop other routine business again due to the influx of COVID-19 patients — as they did early on in the pandemic.    Our ruling Olszewski said, ""It’s not unusual for hospitals to sit at max or near max capacity on any given day.""Hospitals continually adjust their available beds and staffing according to demand because over-staffing is expensive. So it is not unusual for hospitals to operate near maximum capacity. But not all capacity utilization is the same. COVID-19 places additional strains on space, staff and hospital resources, because infected patients need to be kept isolated from others.

194,D.L. Davis,“We are not having replacement birth rates. We have had more people leaving the state than coming in over the last 30 years.”,"There is a worker shortage in Wisconsin. Look no further than the proliferation of ""help wanted,"" ""we’re hiring"" and ""apply within"" signs across the state. Joblessness from the pandemic fallout can be blamed for much of the problem; Republicans and allies have pointed toward enhanced federal unemployment benefits, which they say are keeping would-be workers on the sidelines.In a June 27, 2021 appearance on WISN TV’s ""UpFront,"" Kurt Bauer, president and CEO of Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, pointed to another factor: Demographics.""The demographics are such that we are not having replacement birth rates,"" Bauer said. ""We have had more people leaving the state than coming in over the last 30 years.""It’s a particularly timely claim, with more census numbers rolling out in the coming days and months.Is Bauer right that over the past 30 years more people have left Wisconsin than moved here?‘Wisconsin has work to do’When asked to provide back up for the claim, WMC spokesman Nick Novak said Bauer was making the point that ""Wisconsin has work to do on attracting and retaining workers.""""If we are to keep growing our economy, we will need to reverse both recent and long-term trends of attracting more working-age people to Wisconsin, retaining our workers here and increasing birth rates to no longer be below replacement levels,"" Novak wrote in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.Novak referred to two reports: A 2019 Forward Analytics report ""Falling Behind: Migration Changes & State Workforce"" and to information from the University of Wisconsin- Madison’s Applied Population Lab. We’ll turn to both of them, and some additional sources, as we dig into the claim.Bauer talked about the past 30 years, so that means the period from 1990 to 2020.Changes in population are a dynamic thing, but are based on four fundamental factors: How many people are born, how many people die, how many people move in and how many people move out.You can also measure different portions of the population, for instance breaking it down by age group. In this case, Bauer is mixing together multiple things, when he references both ""replacement birth rates"" and working-age people moving away.The big picture is this: The state’s population in general is growing, while it’s working age population is falling.According to the UW population lab, from 1990 to 2020, the state gained 362,899 people. That includes gains in each decade: 1990s: 227,637 2000s: 79,938 2010s: 55,324So, when looking only at the population in general, Bauer’s claim starts off on the wrong foot. It suggests we are losing population in some form.Featured Fact-checkJoe Bidenstated on January 12, 2023 in remarks at the White House“Take-home pay for workers is going up.”By Louis Jacobson • January 13, 2023 ""The state grew by 9.6% in the 1990s, 6.0% in the 2000s, and 3.6% in the 2010s,"" said John Johnson, research fellow in the Lubar Center for Public Policy Research and Civic Education at the Marquette University Law School.  ""So the issue is a declining rate of growth. We are still growing, just at the slowest pace in the state's history.""That said, Bauer is focused on the working-age population, generally considered those between age 15 and 64. When you look at working-age population, the picture differs.According to  Forward Analytics demographer Dale Knapp, in 1990, some 3,148,742 people fell into the working age category. In 2000, that figure had risen to 3,536,228.In 2010 it had risen to 3,801,879, but by 2020, the number had dropped to 3,745,350.In other words, the working age population saw increases in the two decades from 1990 to 2010, but a decrease from 2010 to 2020.Migration patternsBut what happens when we look strictly at migration patterns? That is, people moving in and moving out. Remember, this was the underlying point of the claim -- that our workforce is suffering because not enough people of working age are moving here.Knapp, director of research and analytics at Forward Analytics, which is affiliated with the Wisconsin Counties Association, examined age-group migration over five-year periods.

Knapp adjusted for deaths, and that gave him a net migration number. The approach has limitations.""That means that I can't look at the 15-64 group in both years,"" Knapp explained. ""That 15-64 year old group in the base year becomes 20-69 five years later.""In any case, here are five-year migration numbers for the 15-59 year old groups as they age to 20-64 over five years:  1990-1995:  +91,8501995-2000:  -8,3452000-2005:  +16,3922005-2010:  -29,237 2010-2015:  -30,953Knapp said he couldn’t provide the 2015-20 numbers yet because he doesn’t have deaths for those years. However, he said, ""the ‘before deaths’ number for that period is -118,034 (that compares to a ‘before death’ number of -78,571 during 2010-15).

196,Tom Kertscher,"Sweden had few COVID deaths in July, despite low vaccination rates, relaxed lockdown rules and low mask compliance.","From the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, Sweden made itself a compelling case study, forgoing lockdowns and mandates,  keeping its society largely open — and prompting claims that it was faring better with COVID-19 than the United States.Early on, we found such statements were overstated. Now, nearly a year and a half later, as the virus’ delta variant spikes cases, the claims have reemerged.One widely shared on Facebook came from Steve Deace, the host of a show on the conservative Blaze TV streaming network. He has promoted Sweden’s approach as better than the United States’.Alluding to the 27-nation European Union, which includes Sweden, Deace wrote: ""In the month of July, Sweden recorded a grand total of 9 deaths with Covid in a nation of over 10 million. Lowest mask compliance in EU, least locked down country in EU from beginning, and just 41% fully vaccinated. Also codes Covid deaths similar to how we do.""Deace’s post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)The post has a point in terms of its characterization of Sweden’s response to the pandemic, its vaccination rate and a relatively small number of COVID-19 deaths in July.But cherry picking one statistic — the raw number of deaths in a single month — leaves a misleading impression of conditions and trends in Sweden.Asked whether he was implying that there is a connection between the July deaths and Sweden’s low vaccination rates, relaxed lockdown rules and low mask compliance, Deace told us: ""I actually trust readers to draw their own conclusions from the data.""How Sweden is differentIn contrast to some of its neighbors and the U.S., Sweden’s society has remained largely open during the pandemic, as the government responded mostly with guidelines, not stay-at-home orders and quarantines. Masks generally were not recommended.In April 2020, in the weeks after the outbreak was declared a pandemic, we looked at two claims that touted Sweden’s more hands-off approach as superior to lockdown policies imposed in Europe and the U.S. We found that infection rate cited in one of these claims was not a reliable indicator of how a country was doing, given that it depended on how much testing was being done; and that Sweden’s COVID-19 death rate was higher than two of its neighbors. As of Aug. 4, 42% of Sweden’s population was fully vaccinated; that compares with 49% in the U.S. and 50% in the EU, according to Our World in Data. Sweden’s guidelines emphasize staying at home, testing, hand washing and social distancing.We found Sweden’s COVID-19 death counts for July 2021 a bit higher than the nine the post claims. Sweden had a cumulative 14,630 COVID-19 deaths as of July 1, 2021, and 14,655 on July 31 — an increase of 25, according to Our World in Data. How the post is misleadingThe post looks at deaths only for July 2021.

At that point, the New Yorker reported, Sweden’s per-capita case counts and death rates were many times higher than any of its Nordic neighbors, all of which imposed lockdowns, travel bans and limited gatherings early on.The latest figures show Sweden’s COVID-19 death rate is lower than in the European Union and the U.S. — but it has more than doubled in the past 10 months. Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s top epidemiologist, told PolitiFact that the death rate has risen in many countries. ""We have had two severe waves. The excess mortality is comparably low,"" he said.Excess mortality, as defined by the World Health Organization, is the difference between the observed numbers of deaths and the expected number of deaths for a specific time period.Our World in Data’s measure of the seven-day rolling average of COVID-19 deaths per 1 million people shows that Sweden had higher spikes than those in the EU and the U.S. at several points during the pandemic, including early 2020 and early 2021. And for most of this year, its per capita confirmed cases have exceeded the figures for the U.S. and the EU.Overall, Sweden’s COVID-19 death rate of 142.5 per 100,000 population is well above neighbors Denmark (43.89), Finland (17.84), Norway (15.03) and Iceland (8.3), according to Johns Hopkins University.As for infections, after a wave in the spring of 2021, Sweden saw its infection rate drop, which officials attributed primarily to vaccinations and to people being outdoors more, Reuters reported. But now it’s on the rise again. In its latest weekly report, on Aug. 5, the Swedish Public Health Agency reported 3,451 confirmed cases of COVID-19, a 30% increase over the previous week. Our rulingDeace claims that Sweden had few COVID deaths in July, despite low vaccination rates, relaxed lockdown rules and low mask compliance.Sweden has imposed fewer restrictions than other countries and had few deaths in July, but its COVID-19 death rate has been above the U.S. and the EU at various times during the pandemic.

197,Paul Specht,"Says he worked to pass the 2018 farm bill “that helped farmers, invest(ed) in rural broadband, and added work requirements for able-bodied adults, Budd voted NO.”","A Republican U.S. Senate candidate in North Carolina is questioning a primary opponent’s commitment to local farmers and to policies championed by former President Donald Trump.Former U.S. Rep. Mark Walker took exception when U.S. Rep. Ted Budd tweeted on July 16 that he supports North Carolina’s agriculture industry. Walker tweeted: ""False. In 2018, while I worked with Ron DeSantis and Pres Trump to pass a Farm Bill that helped farmers, invest in rural broadband, and added work requirements for able-bodied adults, Budd voted NO."" (DeSantis was a Florida congressman then.)Walker, Budd and former North Carolina governor Pat McCrory are three of the biggest names among the six candidates on the Republican side. McCrory, piggy-backing on Walker’s tweet, also took the opportunity to bash Budd.Their tweets aim to erode Republican voters’ trust in Budd, who Trump endorsed. In this fact check, we’ll explore the following questions:Is Walker right about their voting records on the farm bill?Did Walker accurately describe the farm bill’s contents?What does Budd say about the vote, and is his explanation accurate?It turns out, Walker is right about Budd opposing the farm bill. The bill did also expand the government’s rural broadband loan program.But Walker’s suggestion that it ""added work requirements for able-bodied adults"" is misleading. One major reason the bill became law: the Senate scrapped the House’s proposed changes to the welfare eligibility requirements.What the record showsThe federal farm bill is usually renewed every five years. And in 2018, Republicans controlled the House, Senate and White House. However, they struggled to pass legislation as their members disagreed over policies affecting agriculture, food stamps and even immigration.Budd and Walker were in Congress in 2018 and at times voted with different wings of their party on the legislation, which was revised several times.In a May 18 vote on an early version of the farm bill, officially known as the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, Budd voted no and Walker voted yes. While Walker voted with House leadership in support of the bill, Budd opposed it along with members of the conservative Freedom Caucus. The caucus withheld its support because leadership didn’t commit to a vote on their preferred immigration bill.In a June 21 vote, both voted yes on a version that aimed to reform the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known for providing food stamps. The bill sought to tighten eligibility criteria and impose stricter work requirements on up to 7 million food stamp recipients, Politico reported. In a Dec. 12 vote, the House approved a bill that strayed from their June 21 version and adopted more of the Senate’s preferences. Walker supported the compromise bill and Budd voted no. On Dec. 20, Trump signed this version of the bill.Walker’s descriptionWalker said the bill ""helped farmers, invest(ed) in rural broadband, and added work requirements for able-bodied adults.""It’s fair to say the first two claims in that sentence are true. However, the part about work requirements is misleading.The bill that Walker voted on (and Trump signed) famously left out major SNAP benefit changes that the House passed and Trump initially called for. Featured Fact-checkFacebook posts stated on January 13, 2023 in a post“MRNA vaccines are being injected into our food supply.”By Tom Kertscher • January 23, 2023A report by the Congressional Research Service said the bill made only a ""few eligibility changes. Specifically, the bill ""reduced state waivers for work requirements, meaning states could exempt only 12% of their SNAP recipients from work requirements, as opposed to the 15% in the 2014 Farm Bill,"" according to a blog on the Harvard University’s Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation websiteThe omission of major changes, though, was ""key"" in reaching a compromise, according to an expert who wrote a paper on the bill negotiations.It was also one of the reasons Budd opposed it, according to senior campaign advisor Jonathan Felts. ""The 2018 Farm Bill stripped out the important reforms that would have promoted more stringent work requirements for those receiving welfare assistance,"" Felts said.The Walker campaign, for its part, pointed out that Trump announced efforts to increase work requirements when he signed the bill.""Millions of able-bodied, working-age adults continue to collect food stamps without working or even looking for work,"" Trump said during the bill-signing ceremony on Dec. 20. ""Therefore, I have directed (Agriculture Secretary Sonny) Perdue to use his authority under the law to close work requirement loopholes in the food stamp program. Under this new rule, able-bodied adults without dependents will have to work, or look for work, in order to receive their food stamps.""But that effort was separate from the farm bill, and quickly faced legal challenges. Last October, a federal judge blocked Trump’s rule to apply work requirements through the Agriculture Department.Budd’s explanationApart from the SNAP benefits, PolitiFact wondered if the Budd campaign’s description of farm subsidies was accurate. In that email to PolitiFact, Felts described it this way:""As any family farmer will tell you, you don’t support the farm by giving away the farm, and the 2018 Farm bill was bloated with overspending that also left out critical reforms to federal farm subsidies that would have better directed federal assistance to small, family farms that needed it the most.""Vincent Smith, an agriculture policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, agreed that the bill was bloated.Virtually ""any self respecting economist would say that money is flowing to folks that don’t need it and businesses that would be perfectly viable without it,"" Smith told PolitiFact NC in a phone interview.What about Budd’s claim that the bill left out reforms that would have ""directed federal assistance to small, family farms that needed it?"" Smith said Budd has a point, but that his explanation could give people a misconception about American farm ownership.""The candidate is right that these monies (in the farm bill) were heavily targeted to the largest farms,"" Smith said. ""Now, 98% of all farms would describe themselves as family-owned farms. Only 2% are owned by significant corporate entities.""In other words, it would be misleading to suggest the farm bill didn’t help family farms. It did. But Budd is right that larger farms benefit the most from the government’s system for offering more subsidies to farms that produce more crops.To be clear, the bill when signed simply renewed many of the agriculture policies that were already law. And while many agricultural groups supported the bill, it also had its critics.Farm Aid, the group founded by Willie Nelson and other musicians, commended Congress for finally passing the legislation. However, it said the bill ""fails spectacularly"" to address the core challenges facing farms.""The future of family farm agriculture requires a dramatic shift in policy towards fair pricing, supply management programs, cracking down on corporate goliaths and accelerated attention to the climate crisis. By those standards, this farm bill fails,"" the group wrote on Dec. 20.Our rulingWalker said that he voted for the farm bill, which ""added work requirements for able-bodied adults"" and that Budd voted no.It’s true that Walker voted for the bill that Trump signed and Budd voted against it. However, it’s misleading for Walker to say the bill ""added work requirements for able-bodied adults.""Walker voted for more work requirements in a bill the House passed in June, but the version that Trump signed didn’t include those requirements. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

198,Paul Specht,"""Lumber prices can be tied to the (Trump) administration’s actions.""","A North Carolina congresswoman says former President Donald Trump is partly to blame for an increase in lumber prices.U.S. Rep. Alma Adams, a Charlotte area Democrat, raised the issue when questioning Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell about inflation during a committee meeting on July 14. Adams wanted to know why Powell believes the recent inflation trends are temporary. And while winding up for her question, she said a rise in lumber prices ""can be tied to the previous administration’s actions.""""My local housing partnership had to pause construction of an affordable housing site because of a funding gap caused by the spike in lumber prices. And while lumber prices can be tied to the previous administration’s actions, I know that many are still concerned about the rise in core prices."" ""So I’m hoping you can help us put some of these concerns to bed. So would you tell us why you believe the recent inflation trends are temporary as the economy reopens and what other factors are playing into the upward pressure on prices?""Later that day, a Twitter user challenged Adams’ explanation. She responded by elaborating on her comments in a tweet. ""The Trump Administration's high tariffs on Canadian lumber drove prices higher. Supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic compounded the problem and drove prices even higher,"" she tweeted on July 14.Is she right about that?Trump did place a tariff on Canadian lumber and it’s fair for Adams to point out that it caused lumber prices to rise, experts told us. However, experts say lumber prices are more complicated than her statement suggests.There are a number of reasons why the recent rise in lumber prices isn’t entirely — or even primarily a result of — Trump’s tariffs.When prices started to riseBy the time Trump imposed tariffs on lumber in 2017, prices were already on the rise because of uncertainty surrounding an expired trade agreement. The U.S. and Canada had a 10-year trade pact that expired at the end of 2016.David Logan, director of tax and trade analysis for the National Association of Home Builders, wrote in March 2017 that ""failure to reach a new (trade) agreement is the primary catalyst of market-wide price increases.""A month later, the Trump administration announced tariffs of 20% on Canadian lumber and up to 24% on specific lumber companies.Lumber prices have a history of being volatile, experts told PolitiFact. They can range from $300 to $600 per thousand board feet when in stable economic times.The price hovered just below $400 per thousand board feet in early 2017, and then rose to $600 by summer 2018. It’s fair to say Trump’s tariffs contributed to that rise, experts told PolitiFact. Other factors played a role too. Lumber market expert Paul F. Jannke, a principal at Forest Economic Advisors, told the New York Times that a reduction in the supply of Canadian lumber also contributed to the rise in prices.Fast forward to 2020. When the pandemic takes hold, some saw mills shut down or cut production as they anticipate decreased demand. But their predictions were wrong.Featured Fact-checkTweetsstated on January 24, 2023 in a tweetDiamond and Silk pundit died from COVID-19By Paul Specht • February 6, 2023More Americans started to work from home and decided to undertake home renovation projects. Demand for lumber rises and prices reach $950 per thousand board feet in September, according to the NAHB.In the meantime, the World Trade Organization ruled in August that the Trump administration’s justification for the 2017 lumber tariff was off-base. And late last year, the U.S. Commerce Department slashed the softwood lumber tariff to 9%.Prices skyrocket in 2021Last year’s rise in prices was just the start. Lumber prices hit an all-time high of $1,670 per thousand board feet this May as demand rose for a limited supply, CNBC reported.The lumber industry’s struggle to keep up with demand has been well-documented in American media, from Vox and CNN to Fortune and Bloomberg. Experts told PolitiFact there are many factors that determine the price of lumber. Trump’s tariff is one of those factors but isn’t the leading cause of the spike.The price increases ""can be traced back to mill closures and a massive reduction of output upon reopening based on the incorrect assumption that the housing market would indefinitely tank,"" Logan, the NAHB expert, told PolitiFact in April.Sam Spencer, a spokesperson for Adams, said the Congresswoman’s tweet accurately summarized the effect of tariffs.""The price of lumber can be tied to the tariffs: if there is a supply crunch, the fact that we’re artificially elevating the price of that specific commodity’s importation by default contributes to the rise in prices,"" Spencer said in an email.While the tariffs certainly helped cause lumber prices to jump in 2018, ""that second round increase isn’t related to the Trump tariff,"" said Vincent Smith, an expert in agricultural policy at the American Enterprise Institute. ""That was a demand side driven surge.""Adams is ""not wrong about the impact of the Trump tariffs in 2017,"" Smith said, adding: ""that doesn’t explain the surge in prices subsequently.""The softwood lumber tariff ""doesn't help,"" said Thomas A. Firey, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and managing editor of its Regulation Magazine.""However, the tariff is set and adjusted by statute, and it's unfair for the congresswoman to blame Trump for initiating it (or Biden, whose administration is obligated to raise it),"" Firey told PolitiFact in an email.Fact-checkers at USA Today reached a similar conclusion. Scott Lincicome, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Cato Institute, says the fluctuating cost of lumber in the U.S. is a result of a trade system that’s overdue for reform. The regulations affecting how much lumber is made available, who’s allowed to produce it, and how it’s taxed -- are designed to benefit the American lumber industry, sometimes at the expense of the consumer. The system’s drawbacks are exacerbated during seasons of high demand.""It's factually true that the Trump administration’s Commerce Department applied the tariffs, but beyond that casting the blame is pretty nonsensical,"" Lincicome said. Experts pointed out too that Biden was in office as lumber prices peaked, and hasn’t acted to reduce the tariffs. The Commerce Department is now proposing to double the lumber tariff to 18%. CNN and Fortune Magazine report that Biden, for his part, has yet to take a stance on the proposal.Our rulingAdams, referencing Trump’s time as president, said ""lumber prices can be tied to the previous administration’s actions."" She later tweeted an assertion that Trump’s tariffs were a cause.Trump increased the tariff on Canadian lumber in 2017 and prices rose in the following year. However, prices skyrocketed even higher in the last year as a result of pandemic-era market changes. Economists say that’s largely the result of unforeseen issues of supply and demand.While Trump’s tariffs contributed to the record-high lumber prices, economists say it’s misleading to blame them entirely.Adams’ statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

""You're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations,"" Biden said.It is rare for people who are fully vaccinated to contract COVID-19, but it does happen. News reports the week of the town hall show that a White House official and a staff member for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi both tested positive for COVID-19, although both were fully vaccinated, as did a handful of Texas Democrats who recently traveled to Washington, D.C. to prevent passage of Texas Republicans’ election bill. A White House spokesperson pointed to other comments Biden made during the July 21 town hall that less sweepingly characterized vaccinations as protecting people from serious illness or death.""This is a simple, basic proposition: If you’re vaccinated, you’re not going to be hospitalized, you’re not going to be in an ICU unit, and you’re not going to die,"" Biden said. That, too, is a slight exaggeration, although hospitalizations and deaths among vaccinated people are extremely rare. Biden was more accurate when he said vaccinated people who catch COVID-19 are ""not likely to get sick.

Those cases included 5,189 hospitalizations and 1,063 deaths. That data shows that among vaccinated people, approximately 0.0033% were hospitalized and 0.00067% died, said Cindy Prins, an epidemiologist at the University of Florida.""So those are extremely rare events,"" Prins said.Featured Fact-checkLauren Boebertstated on February 7, 2023 in a tweetJoe Biden closed schools during the COVID-19 pandemic.By Amy Sherman • February 8, 2023However, ""it’s not accurate that you won’t get COVID-19 if you’re vaccinated. We have seen enough breakthrough cases to know that for sure. And even the efficacy and effectiveness data show that the vaccines don’t prevent all cases of COVID-19,"" Prins said.It’s difficult to quantify the total number of breakthrough cases. The CDC stopped collecting data on all breakthrough cases in May and is now only collecting data on vaccinated people with COVID-19 who are hospitalized or die.A CDC spokesperson told PolitiFact in May that zeroing in on severe breakthrough cases is meant to provide vaccine researchers with more reliable data on the cases they’re most concerned about, since not all people with breakthrough infections can be identified, particularly those with asymptomatic or mild illness who do not get tested.But even when the CDC was tracking breakthrough cases broadly, they were rare. The data that the CDC collected before May 1 show that, of 101 million people vaccinated in the U.S., 10,262 (0.01%) experienced breakthrough cases, Prins said. ""Bottom line: You can still get COVID-19 if you’re fully vaccinated, but that’s not common, and hospitalizations and deaths from breakthrough cases are very rare,"" Prins said. ""Being vaccinated absolutely helps to prevent COVID-19 infection, and definitely helps to prevent severe disease and death from COVID-19.""We heard similar comments from other experts including Dr. Amesh Adalja, an expert on infectious disease at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. ""Breakthrough infections are extremely rare, and when they are detected are often clinically insignificant and/or the result of testing asymptomatic fully vaccinated (people) against CDC guidance,"" Adalja said.

And earlier this year, the Pew Research Center found that 91% of Americans believe marijuana should be legal in some form. North Carolinians, meanwhile, haven’t been polled many times on whether medical marijuana should be legalized.

Biden entered office during a recession (and a global pandemic), but while the economy was on the upswing.Most other presidents — aside from Barack Obama, who took office during a spiraling economic downturn — have entered the White House amid a growing economy.

202,Madeline Heim,“Wisconsin is 49th in public health spending.”,"Wisconsin’s state budget for the next two years has arrived at the desk of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, lauded by the Republican-controlled Assembly and Senate and opposed by most Democratic lawmakers. The nearly $88 billion spending plan would cut taxes by more than $3 billion, end an eight-year freeze on tuition at University of Wisconsin schools and lower property taxes by about $100 for the owner of a typical home. Republican lawmakers removed hundreds of items that Evers had proposed, including expanding Medicaid, legalizing marijuana, raising the minimum wage and repealing Act 10, the law that restricted collective bargaining for most public employees. They also passed on public health spending that Democrats argue is key to preparing for the next pandemic. Evers had proposed a $53 million boost to state-funded public health activities, including a $5 million annual increase in grants to local public health departments for communicable disease prevention and 23 full-time positions in the Bureau of Communicable Diseases.State Sen. Jon Erpenbach, D-West Point, voiced his displeasure with that decision on Twitter, responding to a June 15, 2021 tweet about Republicans’ health care priorities. ""(Wisconsin) is 49th in public health spending,"" Erpenbach tweeted. ""We just had a pandemic and will be vulnerable to the next one because Republicans are not investing in public health."" The first part of that statement needs more context to understand which ranking he’s talking about — but once we have that context, is it true? Let’s take a look. Rank 49th in federal spending on public health, but higher in state spending When asked for backup for the claim, Kate Constalie, communications director for the office of the senator, said Erpenbach meant that the state was 49th in the nation in federal public health dollars. She pointed to a May 2021 report from Trust for America’s Health, a nonprofit health policy organization based in Washington, D.C., that detailed the federal government’s investment in states’ public health initiatives. Most federal money for public health flows through the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and much of that is rerouted to states to use for specific efforts such as immunization, public health preparedness and chronic disease prevention. But declining funding for the CDC over the past decade has resulted in fewer federal funds for public health, which the report argued set states up to fail during the coronavirus pandemic. Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 18, 2023 in a Facebook post“The average American has anywhere from 5 to 15 pounds” of stool stuck in their gut.By Madison Czopek • January 27, 2023That report said Wisconsin ranked 49th in total CDC program funding to states in fiscal year 2020, which ended in September. The state received more than $108 million, averaging out to $18.65 per person — just about 50 cents more than New Jersey, which was ranked last. In comparison, Washington, D.C. at the top received more than $208 per person, the report found. But Erpenbach’s claim was made in the context of the state budget.And how much money Wisconsin receives from the federal government for public health isn’t anything statehouse Republicans — whom he appeared to be talking about in the tweet — can control. What they do control is how much the state spends on public health. The State Health Access Data Assistance Center, a program of the Robert Wood Johnson program at the University of Minnesota, assembles a yearly ranking of per-person state public health funding. In 2020, it found Wisconsin spent $18 per person on public health, sitting at 42nd in the nation plus Washington, D.C. Below Wisconsin were Michigan, Mississippi, Ohio, North Carolina, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Kansas, Nevada and Missouri. The state actually ranked higher in 2019, at 40th in the nation, despite spending a dollar less per person that year on public health, according to data from the center. So Wisconsin ranks higher in state dollars put toward public health than in what it receives from the federal government — though to be sure, it’s still on the lower end by that measure, too. Since 2010, spending for state public health departments dropped 16% per person, and spending for local health departments has fallen 18%, according to a Kaiser Health News and Associated Press analysis of government spending on public health. Our rulingIn a retort about the state budget, Erpenbach said Wisconsin ranks 49th in the nation in public health spending. While the state ranks next to last in the amount it received from the CDC, the picture is different when looking at state money. By that measure, Wisconsin ranks 42nd in the nation, according to the State Health Access Data Assistance Center. Our definition of Half True is a statement that is ""partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.""That fits here.",Jon Erpenbach,"July 9, 2021",half-true

Chauvin was found guilty of two counts of murder and one count of manslaughter; he was filmed kneeling on Floyd's neck for nine minutes. Prosecutors had sought a 30-year sentence.Another mugshot is of former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke, with the post saying he received six years in prison for murdering a Black boy. Van Dyke was sentenced in 2019 to nearly seven years in prison after being found guilty of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery in the 2014 death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald.Van Dyke shot McDonald 16 times after the teen walked away from an encounter with police officers, according to the Associated Press. Van Dyke arrived on scene after other officers had stopped McDonald and, within seconds, fired his weapon. Prosecutors had sought an 18- to 20-year prison sentence for Van Dyke.The third mugshot is of former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger, who was sentenced by a jury to 10 years in prison in 2019, for the murder of 26-year-old Botham Jean. Guyger was off duty when she entered Jean's apartment thinking it was her own and mistook Jean for a home invader, according to The New York Times. She pulled out her service weapon and fatally shot Jean. Prosecutors had sought a 28-year prison sentence.Sentencing of Black manThe fourth mugshot is of Michael Thompson, a Black man, who was sentenced to up to 60 years in prison after being convicted of selling 3 pounds of marijuana in Michigan to a police informant in 1994.After his initial arrest, police searched his home and found 14 weapons, some of which were antiques and kept in a gun safe, according to CNN. Although most of the guns belonged to his wife, Thompson did own some of the firearms and had prior drug convictions.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 26, 2023 in a postThe officers who beat Tyre Nichols targeted him because he was “allegedly dating” one of their wives.By Madison Czopek • February 1, 2023Under Michigan's habitual-offender law, a judge added sentencing enhancements to extend Thompson’s prison term, CNN reported.

Gretchen Whitmer granted him and three other people clemency and commuted their sentences.Racial disparities in sentencingThe circumstances of the four cases and the sentences vary in ways that complicate direct comparisons.

He served more than 20 years in prison before his sentence was commuted in 2020.Meanwhile, the three white former police officers were given shorter prison sentences than prosecutors sought for their murder convictions.

We took it to mean gain in net worth, which is a measure of a person’s assets minus liabilities. In that sense, Pelosi and her husband have gained considerably more than Trump, even though Trump’s wealth is estimated to be much larger than Pelosi’s.It’s accurate to say Trump had no gain in net worth during his time in office. In fact, estimates are that his net worth dropped by as much as $1.1 billion. Pelosi is one Congress’ richest members, and her financial disclosures show household assets between $57 million and $271 million, mostly her husband’s holdings. But the claim about her wealth gain isn’t supported. There’s not enough information in her public disclosures to show what her net worth is or how much it grew during her time in the House. By one way of estimating it, the gain would be closer to $100 million than $191 million.The comparison also leaves out an important element of context: Time.Trump spent four years in office, a period that saw a pandemic-related crash in the hospitality and commercial real-estate industries, the source of much of his wealth. Pelosi has been a member of Congress for 34 years, a period during which the size of the U.S. economy more than doubled, the stock market grew more than 1,500%, and property values around Pelosi’s hometown of San Francisco skyrocketed in tandem with the rise of Silicon Valley and the Internet.Trump’s net worth Trump’s wealth is enough that it is estimated by major financial publications.As of July 7, Forbes put Trump’s net worth at $2.4 billion, ranking him No. 1,299 on its list of billionaires, mainly from New York City real estate. That was down $1.1 billion from the magazine’s estimate of $3.5 billion when he took office in January 2017. Among the reasons for the decline, Forbes cited a $217 million decrease in the value of a commercial building in midtown Manhattan that briefly went vacant.Bloomberg’s estimates are smaller, but similar. It estimated that as Trump left office, his net worth was $2.3 billion, down from $3 billion. Bloomberg cited, among other factors, COVID-19’s impact on office buildings, and on the hotels and resorts that bear Trump’s name.Trump’s January 2021 financial disclosure showed the Trump Organization’s 2020 revenue was down nearly 38% from a year earlier.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 23, 2023 in a Facebook postVideo shows Rep.

Most of her fortune stems from the investments of her husband, Paul Pelosi, a prominent businessman active in real estate and venture capital for decades. The estimates of her wealth come from financial disclosure forms that all members of Congress must file. But only a range of values, rather than specific dollar amounts, must be reported.Pelosi’s latest annual financial disclosure report, for 2020, was due on May 15, 2021. But she requested an extension, so it’s due Aug. 13. The latest available disclosure is Pelosi’s 2019 report. The assets listed in the report include a home and checking accounts jointly owned by the couple, plus Paul Pelosi’s investments including commercial real estate and shares of blue-chip stocks such as Apple, Facebook, Visa and Walt Disney Co. The listed assets totaled between $57 million and $271 million, and their liabilities were between $20 million and $97 million.So, Pelosi’s net worth as of 2019 could have been as high as $251 million — using the maximum possible value of her assets and the minimum possible amount of her liabilities. Or, doing the reverse, it could be as low as negative $40 million. Taking the midpoints — $164 million in assets minus $58.5 million in liabilities — would put Pelosi’s 2019 net worth at $105.5 million.Pelosi’s 1987 disclosure form shows her assets were at least $3.64 million. Her liabilities were at least $965,000, but because of the way reporting was done then, the top end of the range is not clear.As a result, there isn’t evidence in these filings to establish that her gain was $191 million.Our rulingAn Instagram post claimed that Trump's ""net gain while in office"" was zero, while Pelosi's net gain while in office has been $191 million, suggesting that Pelosi enriched herself as a public servantThe comparison leaves out key context on several fronts.

Also, much of her wealth is from her husband’s investments.Estimates show Trump’s net worth shrank by as much as $1.1 billion during his four years as president.

206,Jill Terreri,“40% of jobs in this country pay less than the average unemployment check of $750/week.”,"Rep. Adriano Espaillat, a Democrat who represents parts of the Bronx and upper Manhattan, weighed in on why businesses are struggling to fill job openings. He blamed low wages. He tweeted: ""So, let me get this straight: 40% of jobs in this country pay less than the average unemployment check of $750/week. There’s no labor shortage, there’s a living-wage shortage.""Is Espaillat right? His deputy chief of staff, Candace Person, sent us two sources to support claim. The first, a news story from CNBC from June 2020, said around 40 percent of all workers could theoretically receive more in unemployment benefits than by returning to work. The story cited an analysis by Noah Williams, director of the Center for Research on the Wisconsin Economy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.As for the amount of the average unemployment check, Person directed us to a public radio story. That story quoted Daniel Alpert, a senior fellow in macroeconomics and finance at Cornell Law school and an investment banker, who said state and federal benefits average about $750 per week across the country. We looked into both parts of Espaillat’s claim. ‘40 percent of jobs’We asked Williams, author of the study cited by Espaillat, about the number of jobs paying less than the average unemployment check of $750 per week. The study took into account the Cares Act, which added a $600 federal unemployment benefit to what each state provides, which varies.  The share of unemployed workers who receive more on unemployment than when they worked is about 40%, he said. But the share of all workers who earn less than the typical unemployment check is lower, around 20%, he said. That’s because people who are unemployed are disproportionately lower-wage workers. Federal unemployment benefits have dropped since Williams’s study, and he said his study’s findings do not directly apply to current conditions. But later research looked at unemployed workers now receiving the $300 federal supplement, in place through September, and 42% of them receive more in unemployment benefits than by working, he said. Featured Fact-checkRobert Orttstated on January 20, 2023 in in a news conferenceIf New York’s proposed limits on natural gas in buildings take effect, the grid today can’t handle the increased electric load.By Jill Terreri Ramos • February 8, 2023$750 per weekThe average weekly unemployment benefit is lower than what Espaillat said, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Williams, from the University of Wisconsin, said that data through the end of April 2021 showed the average weekly benefit from state programs is $317 per week, or $617 with the $300 federal benefit added. Another analysis, using weighted averages based on the state’s average unemployment benefit amount and the number of beneficiaries in the state, found that the average weekly benefit is $348.35, or $648.35 when the federal benefit is added. That analysis is from Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 25 percent of full-time workers earned $657 or less in the first quarter of 2021, while 50 percent earned $989 or less. Data for how much money 40 percent of workers earned is not available.Wayne Vroman, an economist with the Urban Institute, said benefits vary greatly by state. He said the claim that the average unemployment check is $750 could make people think the program is more generous than it really is. We checked with Alpert, an investment banker and senior fellow at Cornell Law School, about his claim that the typical unemployment benefit is $750 per week. He said it will take months to figure out the precise amount, as more data comes in. He based his estimate on survey data, and he acknowledged other analyses could produce a lower estimate.Alpert said he analyzed pay for the 5.7 million low-wage jobs listed among the 8.3 million total job openings in March 2021, as reported by the U.S. Department of Labor. Whether the average unemployment benefit is $617 or $750, it’s still higher than the average weekly wages of the vast majority of the unfilled jobs, he said.(Not all of the jobs in Alpert’s analysis offered full-time work, which is reflected in their low weekly incomes). Our rulingEspaillat claimed that 40% of ""jobs in this country"" pay less than the average unemployment benefit of $750 per week. Espaillat based his tweet on findings from credible sources, but one source was from spring 2020, when federal unemployment benefits were higher. A strict analysis of the available data show that the average benefit across states is around $618, or $648, if a weighted average is used. Some data showed less than 25% of all jobs pay wages lower than the average unemployment benefit.

Joe Biden is digging a hole America can never fill.”,"Four years after passing a major tax cut that slashed federal revenues, Republicans are raising alarms about the national debt again. President Joe Biden has already signed a $1.9 trillion coronavirus and economic relief package known as the American Rescue Plan, and he’s pushing to enact perhaps trillions more in federal spending for infrastructure and other priorities.One Republican argument against these measures has been their impact on the national debt, although Biden has also proposed tax increases to fund some of his plans.Former U.N. ambassador and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a Republican, took a shot at Biden’s fiscal policy in a June 28 Facebook post. ""The national debt is now bigger than our economy,"" she wrote. ""That hasn’t happened since World War Two — and we’re in peacetime. Joe Biden is digging a hole America can never fill. But he doesn’t care. When the bill comes due, he’ll be long gone.""She is correct about the debt ratio — the nation’s publicly held debt did exceed its gross domestic product at the end of 2020, for the first time since World War II. But Haley’s post focused narrowly on one measure of government debt. And it goes too far in associating Biden’s policies with the nation’s debt burden. The two parts of the debt-to-GDP ratio are intertwined: Governments may take on more debt to finance programs that promote economic growth. And as a country’s economy grows, so does its borrowing capacity. But at a certain level, high government debt can also inhibit economic growth by raising borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. The debt reaching 100% of GDP sounds scary, but economists say it’s not necessarily an ominous sign for a country like the U.S. that has strong credit, big reserve assets and expansive borrowing capacity. Such countries can more easily manage their debt loads, and keep their governments functioning over the long term, without resorting to tax increases, said Olivier Blanchard, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, in a 2019 speech. So the ""hole"" Haley refers to doesn’t affect the U.S. the way it would a weaker economy.Still, it’s a development that attracts notice from commentators and politicians, such as Haley, who is a potential 2024 presidential candidate.Two measures of debtThere are two widely used metrics for federal debt, and both are considered valid. Haley’s historical claim about the ratio is right if you use one measure and wrong if you use the other.The smaller of the two figures is known as publicly held debt. This includes the debt held by the general public through Treasury bills, bonds and notes. Some is held by U.S. nationals, and some by foreigners. The larger figure is called gross federal debt. It takes the publicly held debt and adds to it the debt that the government owes itself. This typically happens when trust funds, such as those that pay for Social Security and Medicare, accept federal IOUs.Haley is correct that the publicly held debt recently crossed the threshold of 100% of the nation’s GDP for the first time since World War II. But it’s worth noting that this milestone occurred at the end of 2020 — the last full year of Donald Trump’s presidency. In just that one year, the ratio soared from 79% to 100%, as the government spent heavily to fight the coronavirus and the resulting economic slowdown.Meanwhile, the gross federal debt has been at or above 100% of GDP at every year’s end since 2012. So the year-end level was already there during most of Barack Obama’s administration and through all of Trump’s. Featured Fact-checkAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezstated on January 27, 2023 in an interview with reporters“The largest contributor to the debt ceiling, or to our deficit, has been the Trump tax cuts.”By Louis Jacobson • February 1, 2023!function(e,i,n,s){var t=""InfogramEmbeds"",d=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(""script"");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,""infogram-async""); How much is Biden’s responsibility?A representative for Haley told PolitiFact that her statement was simply stating a fact about the level of debt, and arguing that Biden’s policies would worsen that percentage going forward.But Haley’s use of the word ""now"" in conjunction with the critique of Biden’s policies gives the impression that she holds Biden responsible for a debt milestone that was crossed before he took office.On Biden’s watch, the ratio of publicly held debt to GDP has actually dipped slightly below 100%. At the end of the first quarter of 2021, it stood at 99.75% of GDP. It could fluctuate in the coming months as the post-pandemic economic recovery gains steam.The Congressional Budget Office has projected that the federal debt will dip below 100% of GDP between 2023 and 2025 before rising again to 106% in 2031, due in part to delayed spending provisions of the American Rescue Plan. That analysis assumes that all other tax and spending laws stay the same, so it doesn’t account for Biden’s plans to raise taxes to pay for some of his spending proposals and otherwise increase tax collections.In general, it’s overly simplistic to blame, or credit, any president for changes in the federal debt.Much of our current level of debt has been driven by mandatory spending on Social Security and Medicare, which have been increasing due to the aging of the Baby Boom generation. These expenditures have essentially been on autopilot.For other types of spending, it takes both the president and Congress to enact legislation, and control of the White House and Congress has shifted between the parties in recent years. The Trump tax cuts of 2017 widened the government’s annual deficits substantially, but didn’t move the debt-to-GDP ratio much, because the economy was growing in tandem with government borrowing. Biden has proposed some substantial increases in spending to spur the economy. The American Rescue Plan Act cost $1.9 trillion and, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would increase deficits by $1.8 trillion between 2021 and 2031.Other elements of Biden’s agenda would be offset by tax increases, largely on corporations and the wealthiest Americans. It’s not at all clear that any of Biden’s pending legislative proposals will ever be enacted, much less at the levels he initially proposed for them. His infrastructure proposal, for instance, has already been cut down in size during bipartisan negotiations.""Obviously, trillions of dollars have been enacted under Biden,"" said Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""But so, too, under Trump, Obama, and George W. Bush. Anytime someone tries to pin responsibility for the national debt on one political figure, they’ve got to take a few shortcuts with the truth.""Our rulingHaley said, ""The national debt is now bigger than our economy. That hasn’t happened since World War Two — and we’re in peacetime. Joe Biden is digging a hole America can never fill.""In 2020, at the end of the Trump administration, the publicly held debt did exceed 100% of GDP for the first time since World War II. It’s down since then.A broader measure, the gross federal debt, which includes funds lent from one part of the government to another, has been above 100% of GDP since 2012, well before Biden became president.Changes in federal debt levels are largely driven by mandatory spending beyond the direct control of any president, and much of the rest has been initiated by lawmakers and presidents from both parties. The debt-to-GDP ratio surged in 2020 because of the federal response to the pandemic and the economic contraction.We rate the statement Half True.",Nikki Haley,"July 2, 2021",half-true

That is the highest 12-month rate since 5.5% in the 12 months ending in August 2008.""Well, we’re not even remotely close to a point to say that we’re at rising inflation so no, I wouldn’t agree with that,"" Axne said when asked during a WHO-TV interview in Des Moines if she thought Republicans were correct when warning that federal spending on the last stimulus distribution in March was fueling inflation. ""I mean let’s wait ‘til we have actual, an expert, who says that that’s what’s happening. Right now, we’ve been able to, you know, keep inflation from being a big issue,"" she continued, in the 8-minute, 15-second interview.Axne said in the interview she did not favor a fourth round of stimulus checks.Ian Mariani, Axne’s spokesman, said Axne is not ready to call the 5% figure shown in the report for May a trend because economic experts have not been ready to do that. ""She’s listening to experts who say it’s not a trend,"" Mariani told PolitiFact Iowa.Moreover, it is too soon to analyze whether or not a trend exists because the nation is in the middle of the time period needed to do that analysis, Mariani said. He said Axne is relying on economic analysts to determine how much time is needed to call higher inflation a trend.What economists sayAnalysts already had inflation on their mind as spring wound down. The reported inflation rate in April – 4.2% over the previous 12 months – showed signs of an increase. Consumer prices rose by 3.9% in May but the Democrat-controlled White House and independent Federal Reserve said prices would settle down.  ""Inflation has increased notably in recent months,"" Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome H. Powell said at a June 16 news conference. Driving the increases were price hikes related to COVID-19 pandemic disruptions to the supply chain for many goods and pass-through energy costs, he said. Notably, motor vehicle prices have increased.But, analysts need more information before knowing where inflation is headed, Powell said, stressing patience while analysts see more data in the coming months. ""As these transitory supply effects abate, inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer-run goal, and the median inflation projection falls from 3.4% this year to 2.1% next year and 2.2% in 2023,"" he said.Featured Fact-checkJoe Bidenstated on January 12, 2023 in remarks at the White House“Take-home pay for workers is going up.”By Louis Jacobson • January 13, 2023The Fed’s Open Market Committee had projected these increases in March.

But, he suggested inflation could be higher than the recent norm.""I don’t think anyone thinks the recent rate of price increase is going to continue,"" Furman said in the AP interview. ""The question is, how much does it show? Does it slow down all the way back to the 2% increase every year we used to see? Or, does it slow down less than that, and we’re left with something more like a 3% increase every year?""Our rulingAxne is wrong when she says people aren’t remotely close to saying inflation exists, or that it isn’t an issue.

The problem, he said, is worsening due to President Joe Biden’s immigration policies.""That meth, if you go back 10, 20 years ago, you’d find these places where they’d be cooking this stuff up locally. That’s not what’s happening now,"" DeSantis said at a June 16 news conference. ""It’s almost all coming across the southern border, and it’s been accelerating for the last six months, and it’s deepening the problems that we are having in terms of getting a handle on this in our own communities here in the state of Florida.""Part of DeSantis’ plan to address the problem is sending Florida law enforcement officers to states on the southwest border for about two weeks. At the news conference, with several sheriffs and state Attorney General Ashley Moody standing behind him, DeSantis did not clarify what exactly Florida officers would be doing in Texas and Arizona to assist with border enforcement — generally a federal matter.DeSantis is right about the southwest border now being the most common point of entry for methamphetamine in the United States. But it’s misleading to portray an increase in meth trafficking as a result of Biden’s immigration policies. Increased flows predate Biden’s presidency.DeSantis’ press office did not respond to our requests for more information.How meth is smuggled across the borderMost of the meth available in the United States is clandestinely produced in Mexico and smuggled across the southwest border, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. Mexican criminal groups produce and supply meth that is low cost, highly pure and potent, a recent DEA report said.Traffickers transport and conceal meth using various techniques, including human couriers, parcel services, commercial and private vehicles. In cars, they commonly conceal it in fuel tanks and tires.Meth produced by criminal groups in Mexico has increasingly made its way into the U.S. ever since a 2006 U.S. law banned over-the-counter sales of cold medicines that had ingredients, such as pseudoephedrine, that were commonly used in the U.S. to make meth. That law, and a more potent and lower cost foreign meth, have contributed to decreased domestic production of meth.Increased flow of meth across the southern border is a problem ""of our own creation,"" said Sanho Tree, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies and director of its Drug Policy Project.There’s no precise number for the total amount of foreign meth that comes into the United States — it’s difficult for anyone to quantify how much of it goes undetected and evades seizure by border officials. So it’s hard to say whether that amount has increased over the last six months and at what pace.Featured Fact-checkMark Obenshainstated on January 31, 2023 in a floor speech.“You know how many children are dying across Virginia because of fentanyl poisoning?

Historically, officials seize more illicit drugs at ports of entry than between ports of entry.U.S. Customs and Border Protection publishes data on drug seizure by officers at ports of entry — such as land checkpoints — and by Border Patrol agents who work between ports of entry. The agency offers two sets of seizure data: events and pounds.So far, there’s only data for four full months of Biden’s time. It doesn’t clearly show an ""accelerating"" pace of meth seizure, and most of it has been seized at official checkpoints.In February, officers at ports of entry and Border Patrol agents recorded 342 meth seizure events. That number increased in March to 371, but declined in April and again in May.In weight, officials seized around 11,100 pounds of meth in February; that number increased in March, declined in April, and increased in May to nearly 19,800 pounds.

""The first was a single vote that occurred during the Inauguration, which he did not attend due to limited seating and COVID restrictions. Second, on April 19, he missed the first two votes due to a flight that got him into D.C. later than when the votes started."" But looking back to 2020, voting records show Pocan voted by proxy many more times. Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 23, 2023 in a Facebook postVideo shows Rep.

The final proxy notification in 2020 came on Sept. 11, and didn’t end until the following January. During that time, Pocan voted by proxy for 29 days. Out of the 292 roll call votes Congress took during the 116th session in 2020, Pocan voted by proxy for nearly 90 of them, voting records show. For context, according to online records, U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, D-La Crosse, employed the proxy system for 25 days, between June 2020 and May 2021. And U.S. Rep.

The effect has been a cancellation of a cadet class and the dissolution of some law enforcement units.In a June 3 interview with the Daily Signal, a conservative news site published by the Heritage Foundation, the Texas Republican argued that these changes have led to ""a doubling of murder"" that has been harmful to the city’s Black and Latino communities.Instead, cities should be increasing their law enforcement presence at the ground level to ensure that officers build relationships in their communities, he argued.  ""Why are we going the other way?"" Roy said. ""(Austin leaders say) 'Oh, let's reimagine police by getting rid of them.' What do you have? You have a doubling of murder in Austin, Texas. It's insane."" ""That's not good for the communities that are allegedly being helped,"" Roy said. The City Council’s decision to cut its police budget following massive protests in the wake of George Floyd’s death has already drawn scorn from the state’s Republican leaders. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, for instance, said that the cuts made Austin ""one of the most dangerous cities in America and definitely in Texas."" We rated that claim Pants on Fire.  More than 20 major U.S. cities slashed police budgets in the aftermath of 2020’s nationwide protests against police brutality. Austin’s cuts, which amounted to about one-third of its police department’s 2020 budget, were the largest in the nation. It’s now been eight months since Austin’s police budget cuts went into effect. Have murders in the city doubled since then? Have murders doubled in 2021? It’s not entirely clear what Roy is comparing this year’s homicide numbers to. His office didn’t provide answers to several questions. But since he tied the cause of the rise to police budget cuts, we can infer he’s comparing this year’s levels to the year prior — before and after the cuts took effect.  We found that homicides so far this year are close to doubling the number recorded this time last year. According to monthly crime stats posted by the Austin Police Department, the city has recorded 33 murders from January through the end of May. Last year the city recorded 19 murders in the same five-month span. That’s a 74% increase. But this increase paints a far more dramatic picture than the reality on the ground, experts say. Using a percentage increase to compare small numbers can give the impression of dramatic changes. For instance, the city of El Paso recorded two homicides in the first quarter of 2020 and five homicides in the first quarter of 2021 — a 150% increase.By comparison, the city of Houston recorded 16 more murders in the first quarter of 2021 than the first quarter of 2020. But because Houston’s total homicides is a much larger number, 94 in the first quarter of 2021, the 16 additional murders results in a much smaller percentage increase — 20%.Featured Fact-checkMorgan Luttrellstated on January 10, 2023 in a tweet""Biden drained America's Strategic Petroleum Reserves to the lowest level since 1984.""By Nusaiba Mizan • January 19, 2023Gov.

We rated that claim Half True.""I’ve always been told: don’t use percentages for numbers that are under 50. If you’re looking at 30 or 45, don’t use a percentage difference because the percentage changes are so big,"" St. Edward's University criminologist Carsten Andresen said last year. Because Austin’s homicide totals are low figures, comparing the homicide increase in that way isn’t seen by criminologists as an appropriate characterization. !function(e,i,n,s){var t=""InfogramEmbeds"",d=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(""script"");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,""infogram-async""); Is the heightened murder rate tied to police budget cuts? Any way you measure it, Austin homicide levels are elevated so far this year. But are these numbers high because of the Police Department’s budget cuts? ""It’s fair to say that violent crime has increased in Austin — and everywhere else,"" said Texas State criminologist Sean Roche. According to a report released by the Major Cities Chiefs Association, which combines crime data of 63 metropolitan areas across the U.S., homicides are up by 30% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020. In many cities, homicides upticks have occurred despite increases in police funding since last year. Houston increased Police Department funding by adding $20 million to its nearly $1 billion budget, yet saw a 20% increase in murders in the first quarter of the year. Both Dallas and Fort Worth also increased law enforcement funding while recording upticks in homicides in the first quarter of this year.  Experts say it’s hard, if not impossible, to draw a direct correlation between fluctuations in police funding and crime rates when so many sociological factors are at play, the ongoing pandemic not least among them. ""Say the police are pulling back a little bit. Does that really affect how individual people decide whether to commit murder? We know that a lot of violence is in the moment — it's not a cold-blooded decision,"" Roche said. ""Are a lot of people really going, 'normally I wouldn't try to shoot or knife this person, but I've heard that the police are defunding, so I've decided that murder is the right decision'?"" What is behind increased violent crime rates in Austin and across the nation? Crime trends often are influenced by macro-level drivers, especially during a pandemic. A cocktail of increased unemployment, the gun-buying surge, increased alcohol consumption and drug use can all combine to drive crime rates up. Unmeasurable factors, like civil unrest and political stress, also are in the mix. All of these factors combined to make 2020 a year of high crime, and many of those factors are still present, Roche said. It’s unclear how or if those crime trends will abate as increased vaccination causes the pandemic to recede.  Our ruling Roy said in an interview that police spending cuts in Austin is harmful to Black and brown communities because it has led to ""a doubling of murder"" in the city. The city recorded 19 murders in the first five months of 2020, and 33 murders in the same five-month span of 2021, which is a 74% increase.However, experts say that because these crime totals are low numbers, using percent change comparisons can easily mischaracterize or distort increases. Roy also connects elevated crime levels to the Police Department’s reduced budget. But it’s difficult to draw a direct causal relation between police budget changes and crime stats, and Roy doesn’t provide any evidence.  Crime rates are responsive to a number of sociological factors, and those factors are driving homicide increases in cities across the country — regardless of any increase or decrease in police department funding, experts say.  We rate this claim Half True.",Chip Roy,"June 11, 2021",half-true
214,Paul Specht,"Says North Carolina moved “from among the worst business rankings in the country, to the top 10.”","To hear North Carolina Republicans tell it, they turned their state around.Democrats controlled the state government for more than 100 years before the GOP gained control of the legislature in 2010 and then the Governor’s Mansion in 2012.As state Sen. Paul Newton pointed out in his recent press conference, Republicans swiftly changed North Carolina’s tax codes in 2013 to make the state more appealing to businesses.""Our pro-business policies moved North Carolina from among the worst business rankings in the country, to the top 10,"" Newton said as he introduced the GOP’s latest tax tweaks.This made us wonder: When it comes to business rankings, how big was this turnaround?It turns out, a credible think tank in 2011 did consider North Carolina’s tax codes to be among the least business-friendly in the country. While Republican leaders cited that think tank by name in their press release, Newton overgeneralized. And in doing so, he ignored rankings by at least three media outlets who considered the Tar Heel state to be one of the best places for business.The Tax FoundationWhen we reached out to Newton’s office, spokesman André Béliveau referred us to rankings by the Tax Foundation. The foundation, considered a top independent tax policy nonprofit, for years has been releasing a State Business Tax Climate Index.Béliveau pointed out the Tax Foundation ranks North Carolina 10th this year, after ranking the Tar Heel state as low as 46th in 2011. And the Republicans’ tax changes certainly played a role in the state’s rise in the rankings, said Jared Walczak, the foundation’s vice president of state projects.""Before tax reform, North Carolina's tax rates were relatively high, with generous incentives for select industries, particularly in agriculture and textile manufacturing. These targeted incentives, however, were out of reach for firms outside these traditional industries,"" Walczak told PolitiFact in an email.""In 2013 and thereafter, targeted incentives were pared back, tax bases broadened, and rates reduced. The individual income tax, the corporate income tax, and the franchise tax all saw rate reductions, while tax bases were revised to enhance neutrality so that the code did not put a thumb on the scale, picking winners and losers,"" he said. As a result, Walczak said the state’s domestic product has improved.""In the seven years prior to tax reform in 2013, state gross product only rose 1.8% in real terms, compared to a national average of 5.6%,"" he said. ""In the seven years since — which includes the downturn from the coronavirus pandemic — state gross product rose 9.5%, exceeding the 9% national average.""Other rankingsWhile the foundation obviously wasn’t keen on North Carolina’s tax policies a decade ago, other analysts saw potential in North Carolina.In 2011, the same year the Tax Foundation ranked North Carolina 46th, both Forbes Magazine and CNBC ranked North Carolina the third best state for business. Meanwhile, Featured Fact-checkTweetsstated on January 24, 2023 in a tweetDiamond and Silk pundit died from COVID-19By Paul Specht • February 6, 2023Chief Executive Magazine ranked North Carolina the second-best state for business in the country.PolitiFact reviewed North Carolina’s rankings in Forbes, CNBC and Chief Executive magazine dating back to 2007. In multiple years before Republicans took complete control over state government — including 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012 — the three outlets ranked North Carolina among the top five best states for business.Only once, when CNBC rated North Carolina No. 12 in its 2013 rankings, did the state fall out of the top 10.The disparity between findings by the Tax Foundation's and the others is largely due to ranking methodology.Comparing rankersThe Tax Foundation study focuses solely on taxes, specifically: individual income, sales, corporate income, property, and unemployment insurance taxes. The foundation’s focus ""is narrower than other business indices"" that include other factors, Walczak said.Indeed, the other rankings used such factors as workforce quality, cost of living, and quality of life — elements that elected officials cannot control anywhere near as directly as tax policy.Chief Executive said in 2011 that ""more than 500 CEOs considered a wide range of criteria, from taxation and regulation to workforce quality and living environment, in our annual ranking of the best states for business.""CNBC said they ""scored all 50 states on 43 measures of competitiveness developed with input from business groups including the National Association of Manufacturers and the Council on Competitiveness."" The measures of competitiveness included everything from a state’s tax codes to its infrastructure and cost of living.Forbes said it looked at six categories: ""costs, labor supply, regulatory environment, current economic climate, growth prospects and quality of life.""By focusing solely on a rating defined by tax policy, Newton ignored other ratings that included factors having less to do with partisan control.Rankings by the other outlets are ""all measuring meaningful things and tend to be taken seriously by policymakers and business leaders,"" Walczak said. He noted that CNBC's measures of competitiveness incorporated rankings by the Tax Foundation and other groups.""These indices can provide a helpful snapshot of a state's business climate and identify areas of improvement, though it's important to remember that not all factors they measure matter equally to all businesses,"" Walczak said. ""At their best, these indices are a valuable diagnostic tool and a shorthand way of identifying a state's economic climate and competitive standing. For businesses, moreover, the better indices are a useful rubric when considering states for expansion.""He added: ""No one is going to choose a state just because of its ranking, but these rankings might help create the list of states that merit further consideration.""Our rulingNewton said ""Our pro-business policies moved North Carolina from among the worst business rankings in the country, to the top 10.""This statement gives the impression that North Carolina was ranked among the worst states for business in the country prior to 2013, when the Republicans ushered in sweeping tax reforms.That’s misleading. While the Tax Foundation ranked North Carolina’s tax structure low in 2011, three media outlets with longstanding state rankings of business environments placed the Tar Heel State among the best states for business even before Republicans took control of the legislature.We rate Newton’s claim Half True.",Paul Newton,"June 9, 2021",half-true
215,Nusaiba Mizan,“Right to Work states have: faster private sector employment growth”,"Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, has made no secret about wanting to undo the state’s right-to-work law.But he has powerful opponents.That includes the GOP-controlled Legislature, which has already stripped a provision overturning the law from the governor’s 2021-23 budget. And Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the state’s largest business lobbying group, which on March 9, 2021 -- the sixth anniversary of Wisconsin becoming a right-to-work state -- hailed the benefits of that status.The group issued a tweet that included this claim: ""Right to Work States Have: Faster Private Sector Employment Growth."" Right-to-work laws make it optional for workers to join labor unions. All told, there are 28 right-to-work states, with many concentrated in the south, though many midwestern states -- including Michigan, Iowa and Indiana -- also carry that status. But what about the WMC claim? Does right-to-work status result in faster private-sector job growth?Behind the numbersWhen asked for backup for the claim, Chris Reader, WMC’s senior director of workforce and employment policy, told us the group was referring to ""Right-to-Work Laws: The Economic Evidence (2018 Update)"" by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a national business lobbying group.The document is based on a report the Chamber, which supports right-to-work laws, commissioned from NERA Economic Consulting. A WMC news release quotes an even more specific line from the report: ""Between 2001 and 2016, private sector employment in Right to Work states grew at 27 percent compared to 15 percent in non-Right to Work States.""The numbers may be on point, but the claim runs into problems within the fine print of the report itself, which notes the data can’t be used to demonstrate a causal relationship between right-to-work status and a state’s economic performance. What others say In 2014, when the issue was being debated in Wisconsin, we looked at a series of claims by politicians here and elsewhere about right-to-work laws and found mixed evidence for such connections. For instance, PolitiFact National rated Mostly True a 2011 claim that right to work states ""have much lower levels of unemployment than union states do""  – the levels were lower, but ""much lower"" was a stretch.Featured Fact-checkJoe Bidenstated on January 12, 2023 in remarks at the White House“Take-home pay for workers is going up.”By Louis Jacobson • January 13, 2023And it rated True a claim from then-Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich that  ""The right-to-work states are creating a lot more jobs today than the heavily unionized states."" But in 2013, PolitiFact Ohio rated Half True a claim that ""Six out of 10 of the highest unemployment rates are also in so-called right to work states."" The numbers were right, but it was ""misleading because it implies a cause-and-effect relationship that is bogus.""So, what do experts say about the WMC claim?""Most recent papers use Right-to-Work status as indicating more favorable business climate generally as opposed to the policy specifically,"" Peter Orazem, a labor economics professor at Iowa State University, said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.""I think it would be very difficult to isolate the effect of Right-to-Work in economic growth as opposed to more favorable business climate more generally,"" he wrote. ""There is evidence that firm productivity is stronger and that entrepreneurial activity is more robust in states with Right-to-Work laws, but this may be due to a range of pro-business policies.""Gordon Lafer, a University of Oregon professor and former senior labor policy adviser for the U.S. House of Representatives’ Committee on Education and Labor, said there’s no evidence right-to-work status increases job growth. Lafer is a research associate with the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning institution. ""All the claims that RTW increases job growth come from simply measuring growth in states that do and don't have RTW laws, and assuming -- based on nothing -- that RTW is the cause,"" Lafer wrote in an email. ""But really you're measuring things like the impact of warmer weather and fewer snow days, oil in Texas, tourism in Florida, and other things that have nothing to do with RTW.  ""If you line up all 50 states in order of growth over a decade, you find the states with RTW laws on both ends of the spectrum and every place in between.""Finally, Michael Childers, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Department of Labor Education, said in an email that right-to-work laws lead to negligible changes in employment and pointed to research by the Economic Policy Institute. In its most recent report, issued in February 2021,  the institute noted Montana – which currently does not have a right-to-work law (but is considering one) – had faster job growth than neighboring right-to-work states including South Dakota, Wyoming and Idaho.Our rulingIn a tweet, WMC claimed right-to-work states have faster private-sector job growth than in non-right-to-work states.While the numbers may add up, the report itself says the numbers can’t prove one causes the other.

216,Louis Jacobson,"“The filibuster, if it does not get reformed, still means that maybe 30% of the population potentially controls the majority of Senate seats.”","During an interview with New York Times opinion writer Ezra Klein, former President Barack Obama took aim at the filibuster — the Senate procedural tool that allows a minority of 41 senators to block action on a bill — on the grounds that it’s undemocratic.""The filibuster, if it does not get reformed, still means that maybe 30% of the population potentially controls the majority of Senate seats,"" Obama told Klein. ""And so if you say that 30% of the country is irreconcilably wrong, then it’s going to be hard to govern.""It wasn’t the first time that Obama has criticized the filibuster since leaving office. At the eulogy for John Lewis, the civil rights activist and congressman from Georgia who died in 2020, Obama called the filibuster a ""Jim Crow relic.""In the transcript of the interview with Klein, this passage about the filibuster included a link to a Washington Post analysis of the differences between population and representation in the Senate. However, the Post article doesn’t precisely support what Obama said. We reached out to Obama’s post-presidential press office but did not hear back. Instead, we crunched the numbers from the 2020 Census and concluded that Obama’s overall point had merit but that he misstated the details.In particular, Obama said that states with a small percentage of the population could control ""the majority of Senate seats."" Given today’s partisan tendencies in each state, controlling an actual majority of seats would not be feasible for that small a percentage. However, a small percentage of the population could control enough seats to successfully wield the filibuster, which effectively gives them control over whether a majority can pass legislation.What the Post article saidThe Constitution gives each state two senators, regardless of population, so Wyoming and Vermont have the same representation in the chamber as California and Texas, which have more than 30 times as many people.The Post article cited in the transcript was headlined, ""By 2040, two-thirds of Americans will be represented by 30% of the Senate."" That’s 20 years in the future, but the article goes on to note that even today, the largest 15 states have 66% of the nation’s population, but just 30 seats in the Senate.While the article’s conclusion is generally consistent with Obama’s point, it doesn’t have anything to do with the filibuster or the 60-vote threshold to end one. Rather, the article looked at representation throughout the entire chamber.More importantly, the headline finding from the article is purely numerical, and ignores which party currently holds the smallest states’ Senate seats. In reality, those 35 smaller states have selected a mix of Republican and Democratic senators, so these states would not be likely to form a unified coalition.Taking into account party affiliation But there are ways to look at the question of whether senators from a bloc of smaller states could effectively use the filibuster to steer the Senate for one party. One way is to ask: What is the smallest share of the U.S. population whose senators could block legislation by mounting a successful filibuster, once you factor in the prevailing party affiliation?For this analysis, we used the current partisan breakdown of the Senate. The results could change if seats flip in the next election, or if partisan trends in some states evolve.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 23, 2023 in a Facebook postVideo shows Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez crying after “Ted Cruz gets up and humiliates her to her face.”By Ciara O'Rourke • January 26, 2023We looked at the smallest 21 states that currently have two senators from the same party — 21 because that’s the minimum number of states that would allow one party to prevail in a filibuster, and the same party because in the six states with mixed delegations, the senators’ votes would likely cancel each other out. (We counted the Senate’s two independent members, Angus King of Maine and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, as Democrats, since they caucus with the Democrats.)The 21 smallest states that have two Republican senators account for 29% of the U.S. population. So, by themselves, these states could muster 42 votes to sustain a filibuster, thereby overruling the 71% of the population represented by the other 58 senators.The 21 smallest states with two Democratic senators account for 39% of the U.S. population, meaning that Democrats from these states could mount a filibuster that thwarts senators representing the remaining 61% of the population.So Obama’s remark is a reasonable assessment of how much muscle a fraction of states can flex in order to block legislation in the Senate.How much population is needed to control a majority of Senate seats?But Obama’s claim that ""30% of the population potentially controls the majority of Senate seats"" overreaches. In the Senate’s current makeup, 29% to 39% of the population could control 42 seats — but not a majority of seats in the 100-seat chamber.In reality, neither party today can muster an actual majority, 51 seats, using just states that have unified partisan control of their Senate delegation. Adding Texas and California to the previous tally, the 22 states that currently have two Republican senators represent 38% of the population, and the 22 states with two Democratic senators represent 51% of the population. (The other six states have mixed representation.)These groupings of states produce only 44 seats for either party — not a majority.In the big picture, however, Obama has a legitimate point, said Josh Ryan, a Utah State University political scientist and specialist in Congress.""Essentially a very small population of the country gets to veto legislation preferred by a large majority,"" Ryan said. ""They don't get to control the Senate, but they get to control what passes the Senate.""Our rulingObama said, ""The filibuster, if it does not get reformed, still means that maybe 30% of the population potentially controls the majority of Senate seats.""In the Senate’s current makeup, senators representing 29% to 39% of the U.S. population would be sufficient to mount a filibuster and block a vote on legislation, in a sense controlling what can be passed in the chamber.However, an alliance of states with a combined population that small couldn’t secure a majority of seats in the chamber, unless you ignore today’s strong partisan leanings in most states.We rate the statement Half True.",Barack Obama,"June 2, 2021",half-true

Similarly, Markets Insider shows lumber overall was roughly five times more expensive in April 2021 than a year earlier.Gasoline: Weekly figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show the price was as low as $1.87 in April 2020 and as high as $2.96 in April 2021.Featured Fact-checkInstagram postsstated on January 22, 2023 in an Instagram postThe U.S. chicken and egg shortage is linked to Bill Gates.By Sara Swann • January 25, 2023Wheat: Weekly figures from Markets Insider show a ton of wheat cost as little as $194.75 in April 2020 and as much as $257.75 in April 2021.Coal: Figures from Markets Insider show the price was $39 per ton at the end of April 2020 and $71.90 a year later.Corn: Weekly Markets Insider figures show corn as low as $3.19 per bushel in April 2020 and as high as $7.02 in April 2021.Key reason: Recovery from the pandemicWe examined the threat of inflation in an article in mid-May.Economists said that most of the current rise in consumer prices stems from supply chains having to adjust quickly to greater economic activity after increased vaccination has eased the pandemic. Recent price trends for some basic commodities illustrate the ripple effect of the widespread business shutdowns that hit just a little over a year ago, and the resurgence of demand as vaccinations and declining COVID-19 case numbers promise a return to normal business activity.For example, in the case of gasoline, experts said, tight supplies drove prices up from January, when Biden took office, to April (before a May hacker attack shut down a key pipeline). In general, a president has limited control over the weekly and monthly shifts in gasoline prices.And for plywood, mills that shut down or reduced production during the throes of the pandemic in 2020 still haven’t caught up to increased demand.All in all, the peculiar transition to a post-pandemic economy has produced mismatches in supply and demand that are now driving the sharpest inflation. Economists expect these price increases to reverse once supply chains iron out delays and shortages. The only Biden policy that has affected prices is the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill he signed March 11, said Abdur Chowdhury, an emeritus economics professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee. ""Consumers have ample cash in hand. As the economy reopens, consumer spending on leisure, travel, entertainment and other service-related activities will increase,"" he said.Blaming Biden for the inflation ""seems an exaggeration at best,"" said Jeffrey Miron, a senior lecturer in economics at Harvard University and  director of economics studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""It likely reflects recovery from the recession/pandemic, concerns about monetary policy being too accommodating, as well as concerns that fiscal stimuli, including several adopted pre-Biden, are increasing aggregate demand and pushing up prices.""Our rulingAn image widely shared on Facebook claimed that lumber, gas, wheat, coal and corn cost more ""in Joe Biden's America.""The specific price increases claimed are roughly accurate, but they compared April 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic had all but shut down the economy and driven down prices, with April 2021, as the nation’s recovery from the pandemic was in swing. Economists say that post-pandemic mismatches in supply and demand are to blame for higher prices in April 2021. While presidents often get blamed for inflation, in this case the sharp contrast in prices from a year earlier is due mainly to the economy having hit a low in April 2020.For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.",Facebook posts,"May 27, 2021",half-true
218,Clara Hendrickson,A Republican bill in Michigan “would make it a crime for election officials … to share information about how to vote by mail and where to find a ballot drop box.”,"Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, the state’s top election official, says a Republican-backed bill would prevent election officials like her from doing an important part of their job: sharing information with voters about how to exercise their right to vote.Benson, who is running for reelection next year, has repeatedly clashed with GOP lawmakers over a package of bills that seeks to revamp the way elections are conducted in the state and curtail her office’s powers. She has objected in particular to GOP bills that would restrict access to absentee voting; in 2018, Michigan voters overwhelmingly supported an initiative that enshrined expanded access to mail ballots in the state’s constitution.One of the GOP bills, ""would make it a crime for election officials (including Secretary Benson) to share information about how to vote by mail and where to find a ballot drop box,"" Benson’s campaign said in a May 20 fundraising email.We looked at Benson’s claim and found that it overstates the proposed restrictions in the bill, Senate bill 305. It would not absolutely prohibit her office or clerks’ offices from communicating with voters.At the same time, county and local clerks and legal experts say that the bill would prohibit many of the methods election officials currently use to inform voters, and that its vague wording could expose officials to criminal charges for conventional methods they commonly use to communicate with voters.What the bill saysAhead of elections, election officials routinely send out postcards and newsletters telling voters about registration deadlines and how to request an absentee ballot. Those communications often include the official’s name and sometimes their image. Clerks say this helps reassure voters that they are getting information from an official government source, rather than a party or campaign office.The bill in Michigan’s state Senate would bar the secretary of state as well as county and local clerks from using their name or likeness on publicly funded communication about an upcoming election. A violation would constitute a misdemeanor, and election officials would be subject to a fine of up to $100 for a first offense and up to $250 for any subsequent offense.The legislation defines communication as including mail, billboards, radio or television advertisements, social media posts or advertisements. It defines election-related information as dealing with voting, registering to vote, applying for an absentee ballot, submitting an absentee ballot, finding a polling location, monitoring the status of an absentee ballot or recruiting election inspectors.The bill would not prevent the secretary of state's office or clerks' offices from putting up billboards, posting to government-run social media accounts or mailing out information about how to participate in an upcoming election — so long as the name or photo of the secretary of state or clerk isn’t included.Republican state Sen. Dale Zorn, who introduced the bill, did not testify in support of it during an April 28 Senate Elections Committee meeting, and his office declined to respond to a request for comment.Republican state Sen. Ed McBroom, who spoke in favor of the legislation during the committee meeting, said the bill is designed to prevent electioneering by officials who oversee elections, even though the bill also applies to clerks who are appointed and elected clerks who are not up for reelection.But election officials and legal experts say that because the bill as it’s currently written does not narrowly define election-related communication, it could limit a wide range of avenues through which election officials currently communicate with voters.Michigan Department of State spokesman Jake Rollow said that ""the bill would make it a crime for Secretary Benson or any election official to use traditional methods to inform their communities about elections.""""Even many social media accounts of their offices and departments, which include the name and image of their elected or appointed leader, would be banned from voter education and other critical election-related communications,"" he said.Featured Fact-checkPublic Interest Legal Foundationstated on January 18, 2023 in a reportIn California, there were “10 million mail ballots unaccounted for” in the November midterm election.By Jeff Cercone • January 26, 2023""There is simply no evidence that it would strengthen our election system in any way,"" Rollow added, ""but there is plenty to suggest that restricting voter education would lead to voter confusion, suppression and disenfranchisement.""What kinds of communications could be restricted?John Pirich, an elections attorney who represented former President Donald Trump in a 2016 election lawsuit, said the bill would prohibit clerks from replying to a voter’s email with an email address or signature that includes their name. Delta Township Mary Clark, a Democrat, said that in the months leading up to the Nov. 3 election, she was personally communicating with voters multiple times every day about the upcoming election.Many clerks’ websites which provide information about registering to vote and requesting an absentee ballot include a photo and name of the clerk. Such identifying information would have to be removed to comply with the proposed law, according to Steve Liedel, an attorney and former legal counsel to Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm.Midland County Clerk Ann Manary, a Republican, said that the bill would also bar some social media posts informing voters about how to participate in an election. ""We like to do live videos and put them on the county’s Facebook page, and we would be prohibited from doing that,"" she said.Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum said she interprets the bill as also prohibiting election-related posts from her personal Twitter account, which she uses regularly to debunk election misinformation. Liedel said that while social media accounts are free to create and use — and not publicly funded — clerks could run into problems posting from a personal account under the bill if they do so from a work phone or computer or a personal device connected to their office WiFi or while sitting in their office.Clark and Manary, who testified against the bill on behalf of the Michigan Association of Municipal Clerks and the Michigan County Clerks Association, respectively, said it threatens clerks’ ability to share trusted information with voters and subjects them to criminal penalties that don’t apply to other elected officials.""We feel that our name is validation to our voters that it’s legitimate information when there’s so much misinformation in our world right now,"" Clark said. ""Clerks are the single most trusted source of election information.""How exactly the bill would affect the way clerks communicate with voters won’t be fully understood until the final language is hammered out. The bill is in committee right now and could change once it reaches a vote in either the Michigan House or Senate. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is likely to veto it, and even if it were enacted, it would almost certainly face court challenges.""I just can’t see a court upholding a prohibition of a properly elected official communicating with their elected title and name to give this information,"" Pirich said.Merissa Kovach, the policy strategist for the ACLU of Michigan, said that Benson’s characterization of the bill misses the mark. Election officials ""could tell you where to vote but they couldn’t do it with attaching their name to it at all,"" she said. In some instances, the change would be a matter of removing a clerk’s name and photo from a mailer or billboard.But in other instances, she said, the bill would require clerks to operate behind a veil of anonymity in situations — like sending an email — where it makes sense to tell voters who they are.""I’d be worried about clerks just constantly being scrutinized and at risk for committing crime and for doing the very basics of their job,"" she said.Our rulingBenson’s campaign claimed that a GOP-backed bill would make it a crime for election officials to ""share information about how to vote by mail and where to find a ballot drop box.""Benson’s claim is partially accurate. The bill, as it’s phrased now, would not broadly prohibit election officials from sharing such information, but election officials say that as a practical matter, it would bar them from many of the methods they currently use to help voters, and that the language of the bill would leave them exposed to criminal charges for routine communications with voters.We rate it Half True.",Jocelyn Benson,"May 26, 2021",half-true

Ron Johnson — who has not yet announced whether he will seek a third term.In an April 11, 2021 tweet, Nelson used the issue of student loan debt to further his argument.""Since 2010, student debt has increased by 102% and real wages have *fallen* by over 8%,"" he tweeted.Is Nelson on to something here? Not exactly.Wages vs. student loan debtWhen asked for evidence to support Nelson’s claim, his campaign acknowledged that they couldn’t find data to match the specific numbers he cited and deleted the tweet. But they argued the broader point still stands — that student loan debt is outpacing wages.So, we decided to take a look at the numbers.First, a programming note: There are multiple measures for analyzing economic trends over time. Nelson cited real wages — or wages adjusted for inflation — so that will be our focus here. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the annual average weekly earnings for all employees sat at $353.53 in 2010 and increased 10.8% to $391.90 in 2020. (Note: These numbers are all in 1982-84 dollars, per the standard used by BLS.)

Quite the opposite — they have increased.Meanwhile, data from the Federal Reserve of St. Louis showed the total student loans owed in the fourth quarter of 2010 sat at around $855 billion. That skyrocketed to $1.7 trillion by the end of 2020, which was a nearly 100% increase.What’s more, Experian found that the average individual loan balance grew by over $3,000, or 9%, from 2019 to 2020 alone and 6% from 2015 to 2019. That means Nelson was generally on target with how much student debt has risen.But he flubbed the comparison.Our rulingIn a since-deleted tweet, Nelson said ""since 2010, student debt has increased by 102% and real wages have fallen by over 8%.""Student loan debt has increased astronomically during that time period, so Nelson was on the mark there.

Pat McCrory is sounding the alarm about how remote learning may affect students long-term.McCrory, who’s running for U.S. Senate, talked about third-grade reading scores on his podcast on May 4.""The latest statistics coming out of North Carolina is the following,"" McCrory said. ""75% of third-graders in this year’s class are not reading at a third grade level,"" he said. ""And guess what? If you’re not reading at a third grade level by the time you get out of third grade, there’s probably an 80% chance that you will not graduate.""Is it true that 75% of North Carolina’s third-graders aren’t reading at grade-level? And is it true that there’s an 80% chance those kids won’t graduate high school?McCrory’s first claim has factual basis but needs context. As to the second part about graduation, it appears McCrory mischaracterized a different stat about high school dropouts. Researchers have found a link between third-grade reading and high school success — but McCrory’s statistic is way off.North Carolina studentsMcCrory said ""75% of third-graders in this year’s class are not reading at a third grade level."" This claim isn’t entirely wrong, but it lacks essential context.According to data presented Feb. 9, 75% of third-grade students who’d taken the beginning-of-grade test were not reading at the third-grade reading level. The News & Observer wrote about the data when it was released.McCrory’s listeners could get the impression that 75% of students are on the verge of finishing third-grade without hitting their reading comprehension goal. McCrory’s podcast aired in May, and many districts plan to end their school year in June.Officials with the state Department of Public Instruction (DPI) say it’s important to remember that the test is given to students who haven’t completed the third grade yet. And it’s usually used as a benchmark to see what kind of growth takes place over the course of the school year.Students typically take the beginning-of-grade (or BOG) test in August or September, around the start of the new school year. Due to the unique challenges of the 2020-2021 school year, school districts were allowed to administer these beginning-of-year tests as late as March 12. The pandemic disrupted the school year and districts returned to in-person learning at different times. So it’s not clear exactly how much later the tests were taken, said Mary Lee Gibson, a DPI spokeswoman.""The data of when most tests were administered is not readily available since it was an on-going testing period as students return to school,"" Gibson said. Still, she said the test should not be characterized as a ""midyear assessment.""While McCrory cast this year’s test scores as a cause of remote learning, it’s helpful to note that the scores aren’t far off from last year’s beginning-of-year results, DPI spokesman Todd Silberman said.Featured Fact-checkMarjorie Taylor Greenestated on February 1, 2023 in a House committee hearingIllinois “received $5.1 billion at an elementary school there that used it for equity and diversity.”By Jeff Cercone • February 3, 2023""There was some shifting across the academic achievement levels, but the total proficient/not proficient was fairly close to the previous year,"" Silberman said. ""The percentage of students scoring at level 1 and level 2 (not proficient) on the BOG in at the start of the 2019-20 school year was 73.6%."" Students tend to fare better by the end of the year. The 2018-2019 was the most recent school year not affected by the COVID pandemic. That year, the number of non-proficient readers dropped from 72% at the beginning of the year to 43% at the end of the school year.Additionally, DPI officials say it’s also important to remember that reading comprehension is not the sole determiner of whether a student will progress to the next grade level.""The Beginning of Grade test is used as a benchmark for where students enter third grade after summer to compare with the End of Grade assessment, showing students’ progress over the year,"" Gibson said.Predicting high school successNow to the second part of McCrory’s claim. He said that if students aren’t reading at grade-level by the end of the third grade, ""there’s probably an 80% chance that you will not graduate.""Experts say third-grade reading comprehension levels can be a strong indicator of success in high school. However, we couldn’t find the source for McCrory’s ""80%"" claim.Campaign spokesman Jordan Shaw said McCrory was referring to a statistic mentioned in a recent EdNC blog by Mary Ann Wolf, president and executive director of the Public School Forum of North Carolina. Wolf said ""88% of students who drop out of high school were not reading on grade level in third grade,"" citing a 2010 study by the Annie E. Casey Foundation. That’s not the same thing as what McCrory said. Wolf’s stat is about reading comprehension scores among drop-outs, while McCrory’s stat is about predicting high school success.The Casey Foundation actually addresses the issue at-hand in its 2012 book, ""Double Jeopardy: How Third Grade Reading Skills and Poverty Influence High School Graduation."" The foundation’s webpage for book says ""about 16% of children who are not reading proficiently by the end of third grade do not graduate from high school on time.""The Casey Foundation study research is considered credible and is cited frequently, said Megan Walcek, senior communications manager for GreatSchools.org. It ""has been cited over 1,000 times, which is a good indicator that the academic community finds it reliable,"" she said.The U.S. Department of Education’s Regional Educational Laboratory Program in 2018 cited the Casey Foundation’s book, saying ""One in six children who are not reading proficiently in third grade do not graduate from high school on time.""To be sure we hadn’t overlooked another significant study on the issue, PolitiFact NC reached out to multiple experts — including N.C. State University’s College of Education — about high school graduation odds for students who finish third grade without reading at grade-level. None of them had heard of a drop-out rate at the level McCrory described.""80% sounds high to me,"" said Dennis Davis, associate professor of literacy education at N.C. State University.""I would be cautious about any claim that says there’s ‘probably’ an 80% chance you will not graduate,"" said Fran Abrams, chief executive of the Education Media Centre, a research group based in London.Our rulingMcCrory said ""75% of third-graders in this year’s class are not reading at a third grade level,"" adding, ""If you’re not reading at a third grade level by the time you get out of third grade, there’s probably an 80% chance that you will not graduate.""The first part of his claim has factual basis but ignores that the source of his data is the beginning-of-grade test. The second part of McCrory’s claim, meanwhile, is way off.

222,Louis Jacobson,“The research showed … that confidence overall in the vaccines increased after the pause” to review the safety of Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine.,"In mid-April, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control recommended a ""pause"" in the administration of Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine, saying that blood clots in a tiny fraction of cases required further review.Ten days later, after completing the safety review, both agencies recommended ending the pause and resuming use of the J&J vaccine. The pause prompted some observers to worry that the federal action could elevate public concern about the safety of the J&J vaccine in particular, and about coronavirus vaccines in general.These concerns were heightened by the near-simultaneous slowdown of immunization rates in most states, as the shrinking pool of unvaccinated Americans became more filled with people who were vaccine hesitant.On May 9, Jeffrey Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, tried to bolster the notion that the vaccines are safe — claiming that the J&J pause only strengthened that view among the public, rather than undermining it.""The research showed ... that confidence overall in the vaccines increased after the pause,"" Zients said on CNN’s ""State of the Union.""When we looked at polling data, we found some evidence to support Zients’ view but also found survey results that suggest damage has been done to the public’s view of J&J’s vaccine in particular, and perhaps to the others. The picture is more mixed than either solely positive or negative.Evidence backing up Zients’ assertionOne piece of evidence that supports Zients’ case comes from a survey sponsored by the de Beaumont Foundation and conducted by pollster Frank Luntz.The survey, which was taken a few days after the pause was announced, found that overall, 40% of respondents said they were more likely to get one of the vaccines than they had been a month before.Meanwhile, weekly polls by YouGov for The Economist have shown slightly declining hesitancy about getting vaccinated since before the pause began. In the poll taken from April 3 to April 6, prior to the pause, 40% of respondents either said they wouldn’t get vaccinated or weren’t sure about getting vaccinated. In the subsequent four polls, that number was 41%, 35%, 33%, and 32%, with the final poll taken between May 1 and May 4.Another poll, sponsored by the media outlet Axios and conducted by the research firm Ipsos, found no evidence of wider vaccine hesitancy after the pause was announced.The Axios poll, which was taken several days after the de Beaumont poll, found that 20% of respondents said they were ""not at all likely"" to get the vaccine as soon as it was available to them. That percentage has shown little change since it was asked in early January 2021.Another data point suggests that Americans felt comfortable with the pause. The Axios poll found that 91% of respondents were aware of the pause, and that of those, 88% said it was a responsible decision. (When we asked the White House for support for Zients’ statement, a spokesperson directed PolitiFact to both the de Beaumont and Axios polls.)Featured Fact-checkRon DeSantisstated on January 17, 2023 in a press conference""Almost every study now has said with these new boosters, you're more likely to get infected with the bivalent booster.""By Yacob Reyes • January 20, 2023Finally, some polling evidence suggests that while J&J’s vaccine was hit by a decline in confidence, the two other vaccines used in the United States, one produced by Pfizer and BioNTech and the other by Moderna, were spared.On the one hand, the Economist/YouGov poll, which surveyed Americans both before and after the pause began, found confidence in the J&J vaccine declining after the pause. Among respondents who answered before the pause was announced, 52% considered it to be ""very safe"" or ""somewhat safe."" That fell to 37% for respondents who answered after the pause was made public.Yet that decline was not mirrored in their view of Pfizer and Moderna. For both those vaccines, nearly 60% of respondents said they believed they were safe — numbers that were essentially unchanged from prior surveys.Another poll, by Dynata for CNBC, showed similar results. The first choice brand for respondents was Pfizer, at 35%, followed by Moderna and J&J at 17% each. That result marked a significant dropoff for J&J compared with the previous month’s version of the poll, which found that the J&J vaccine — which unlike the other two can be taken in a single shot — had been the favorite of 29%. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, by contrast, both increased their share on this question.Other polling shows some caveatsThe strongest evidence against Zients’ assertion comes from a poll taken by the Kaiser Family Foundation in the second half of April. Among those who said they were not yet convinced they should get the vaccine right away, 81% reported that they worried about serious side effects from the vaccine — an increase from 70% the prior month. For women, who accounted for the bulk of the reports of blood clots among J&J recipients, concern increased even more. The share with those concerns rose 15 percentage points, from 77% in March to 92% in April.Meanwhile, other surveys mirrored the YouGov poll’s finding that public concern about the safety of J&J’s vaccine was higher than for either Pfizer or Moderna.The Kaiser poll found that 46% believed the J&J vaccine was safe, far below the 69% who said the same for both Pfizer and Moderna. This sentiment was even more pronounced among respondents who told Kaiser they would ""wait and see"" about whether to get a vaccination — essentially, the group of ""vaccine hesitant"" Americans. Among these respondents, more than half said they thought Pfizer and Moderna were safe, compared with just 28% who said they believed J&J was safe.The ABC News-Washington Post poll found similar discrepancies by brand. After the pause, slightly fewer than half of respondents considered the J&J vaccine to be ""very"" or ""somewhat"" safe, compared with better than 7 in 10 respondents for two rival vaccines. And among respondents who were not yet immunized, J&J’s reputation was even worse — fewer than one-third said it was safe.Our rulingZients said ""the research showed … that confidence overall in the vaccines increased after the pause"" to review the safety of Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine.There is evidence to support his assertion. A de Beaumont Foundation poll found greater enthusiasm to get a vaccination after the pause; YouGov polls show slightly declining hesitancy; and an Axios/Ipsos poll found no softening of interest in getting a vaccination despite the pause.However, there’s also evidence that the pause worried Americans. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey found rising concerns about side effects after the pause was announced. And polls by Kaiser, YouGov and ABC and the Washington Post found low and — after the pause was announced — worsening trust of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, even if that did not spill over into sentiments about the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.We rate the statement Half True.",Jeffrey Zients,"May 14, 2021",half-true
223,Sasha Hupka,"“After California taxes, Trey Lance's $34.1M rookie deal becomes just $16M.""","Days after rookie quarterback Trey Lance signed to the San Francisco 49ers after being taken third overall in the National Football League draft, an image posted on Instagram kicked off debate over how much of his $34.1 million deal might go to California income taxes.The image, posted on May 3, shows a photo of California Gov. Gavin Newsom laughing, which is superimposed over a photo of Lance on draft day. Text in the image states, ""After California taxes, Trey Lance's $34.1M rookie deal becomes just $16M."" It was originally posted by Sports for Simps, an account with around 17,000 followers that shares content related to football. Later, it was reshared by Catchcentral Sports HQ, a page with more than 70,000 followers.The original post included a caption that read: ""Californians: OUR CONTRACT,"" a reference to a series of memes satirizing socialism. It gained more than 17,200 likes and 1,600 comments, many of which criticized California’s income tax rates. But are the numbers in the image accurate, or is this a false start?Facebook flagged this image as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed, so we decided to find out. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook.)Running the numbersLance’s contract with the 49ers stipulates that he will receive a $22.1 million signing bonus in addition to his annual salary from the team. His entire contract is valued at $34.1 million and is valid for four years, with the option of a fifth-year extension.Assuming Lance lives in California, files as a single individual and claims an income of $34.1 million, he would pay roughly $18.1 million in federal and state income taxes given current tax rates. Of that $18.1 million, roughly $830,000 would be taken out in payroll taxes, about $12.6 million would be claimed by the federal government, and California would be owed $4.5 million. After paying that $18.1 million in income taxes, Lance would be left with approximately $16 million — although he would also possibly have to pay property taxes if he owns real estate and sales taxes on items he buys.But because the deal runs for four years, Lance won’t receive the entire sum of his contract upfront. His salary will be paid on a set schedule over that time. Traditionally, the NFL has also paid large signing bonuses in several installments. However, this is a part of the contract that is negotiable, and Lance’s agents will likely maneuver to have his signing bonus paid as a lump sum, since 2019 second overall pick Nick Bosa got his bonus as a one-time payment from the 49ers.According to tax experts, there are tax implications surrounding whether or not Lance gets his money all at once or in a series of installments over the course of several years. Income taxes are progressive, meaning that the tax rate progresses from low to high over the amount an individual earns. For someone filing as a single individual in California, all income over $599,012 is taxed at 12.3%. There’s also a 1% mental health services tax on income over $1 million. But income under those bars is taxed at lower rates. For Lance, this means that his first $599,012 in income will be taxed at a lesser rate than any income over that which he claims for any given year and he won’t have to pay the mental health services tax on his first million dollars each year. By spreading out his income, he can make the most of those lower tax rates, said Alan Auerbach, a professor of economics and law at UC Berkeley and the director of the Burch Center for Tax Policy and Public Finance.The same concept applies to federal income taxes. So, by spreading out his income, Lance could also score savings there. Federally, the top rate is currently 37% on income over $518,400.Other factors that could fumble tax estimatesThere’s a number of other complications that make it difficult to determine how much Lance might pay in taxes over the next four years.He could see his taxes go up if his income increases because he signs endorsement deals or establishes other streams of income. They could go down if he opts to donate money and takes advantage of tax breaks available for charitable giving. His taxes could also be impacted by future uncertainties. For instance, Lance could get married, which would change his filing status, or have a child, which would add a dependent to his taxes. Outside of Lance’s personal life, there is currently a pending bill in the California Senate that would increase the state’s top tax rate to 16.8%. The law would also apply retroactively to January 1, 2020.Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on January 17, 2023 in an Instagram postCNN reported that Damar Hamlin’s doctor confirmed his cardiac arrest was caused by a COVID-19 vaccine booster.By Ciara O'Rourke • January 19, 2023David Kline, vice president of communications and research for the California Taxpayers Association, said the bill isn’t expected to pass this year. Still, there have been other proposed bills that could impact high-earners’ tax burdens, and Kline said it is ""impossible to predict"" what may or may not be approved by the legislature over the course of four years, and difficult to calculate a tax bill with no knowledge of how Lance’s money and life might change.""We always caution that there are a lot of variables that impact income taxes,"" Kline said. ""It is important to let people know that it is impossible to determine the exact amount without knowing the taxpayer's filing status, number of dependents, total income from other sources, possible losses, whether a mortgage interest deduction applies, amount of charitable deductions and other details.""What do other rookies’ taxes look like?Many of the comments on the image posted on Instagram drew comparisons between Lance’s taxes and those of others in the 2021 first-round draft, particularly Trevor Lawrence, the first overall pick in this year’s draft who signed to the Jacksonville Jaguars with a $36.7 million deal.The comments noted that California has the highest state income tax rate in the nation. Meanwhile, Florida does not have an income tax, so Lawrence would primarily be concerned with his federal taxes, which are estimated to be around $13.6 million. Ultimately, Auerbach and Kline said Lance will almost certainly end up paying more in taxes than Lawrence and most others in the first-round draft. ""Athletes who play for California teams are going to pay higher taxes than they would if they played in any of the other 49 states,"" Kline said.Still, that doesn’t mean that Lawrence and other players in low-cost states get away scot-free. One complication surrounding NFL players’ taxes is that they also have to pay income taxes whenever they travel for games and practices — a levy colloquially known as the ""jock tax."" It means every time Lance travels outside of California for a game, he’s racking up bills in other states based on his annual salary and working days in that location, and every time a player from outside of California comes into the state for a game or practice, tax law stipulates that they need to pay for the ""service days"" they spend in California.Because California has the highest top income tax rate in the country, Auerbach said most of the state and local taxes Lance needs to pay while traveling should be deductible against his California tax bill, meaning that they’ll likely have no impact on the overall amount he pays in taxes.They would, however, potentially impact his competitors outside of California. In the past, Kline said California has also taxed athletes endorsement income if they fulfill elements of their contracts while in the state.""When a Florida resident like Tiger Woods played in a gold tournament in California wearing a Nike hat, California sought to tax a portion of the Nike endorsement contract on the grounds that some of the income was attributable to wearing the hat while in California,"" Kline said.California’s Franchise Tax Board, which collects and audits income taxes, writes in their Residency and Sourcing Technical Manual that endorsement cash can be taxed if an athlete is ""wearing or using [a] sponsor's product,"" ""making promotional appearances"" or ""participating in photo and filming days"" on and off the field in California. That means that Lawrence and other players outside the state could pay a pretty penny for promoting Nike or Adidas on Lance’s home turf.Our rulingAn image posted on Instagram claimed that rookie quarterback Trey Lance, who recently signed to the San Francisco 49ers, will take home $16 million from his $34.1 million deal after paying California income taxes.Given current tax rates, this seems to be a reasonable estimate of how much Lance might take home after paying federal and state income taxes on his contract with the NFL. He will pay significantly more in federal income taxes than in state income taxes — about $12.6 million compared to an estimated $4.5 million.Additionally, tax experts caution that it is impossible to determine exactly how much Lance will pay in taxes because his tax burden will be impacted by when he earns his income, his filing status and his charitable contributions, among other personal factors.Lance could also establish endorsement deals that increase his income, which would affect his taxes. Since his contract with the 49ers runs for four years, he could be impacted by changes to state and federal tax rates and laws surrounding tax breaks and deductions.And while Lance will almost certainly pay more in state income taxes than some of his competitors in low-cost states, they’ll be hit with the same high tax rates every time they travel to face off against the 49ers in Santa Clara.In short, while the estimate is reasonable, it’s also exactly that — a rough estimate that’s missing a little context.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)Here’s what really happened: Gianforte announced on May 4 that Montana planned to leave the federal program that established extra benefits for people receiving unemployment assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Montanans would still be eligible for state unemployment benefits, just not the federal enhancement. With the federal program still in place, unemployed Montanans were eligible for between $451 and $810 per week in benefits. In June, when Montana is scheduled to leave the program, weekly benefits are set to fall to between $151 and $510 per week.Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on January 17, 2023 in an Instagram postCNN reported that Damar Hamlin’s doctor confirmed his cardiac arrest was caused by a COVID-19 vaccine booster.By Ciara O'Rourke • January 19, 2023As part of the CARES Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in March 2020, the federal government approved $600 in additional weekly benefits for unemployed workers on top of state unemployment benefits. After that benefit expired in July, it was replaced by $300 weekly payments included in another relief package in December. The American Rescue Plan, the $1.9 trillion package that  President Joe Biden signed in March 2021, extended those benefits through Labor Day. Gianforte cast his plan to leave the federal program as an attempt to combat a state labor shortage. ""Montana is open for business again, but I hear from too many employers throughout our state who can’t find workers. Nearly every sector in our economy faces a labor shortage,"" he said in a statement. Withdrawing from the federal program is one of two measures that Gianforte announced in May to spur hiring. The second is the launch of a return-to-work program that will grant previously unemployed Montanans a $1,200 bonus if they remain steadily employed for at least a month. The return-to-work bonus will be federally funded by the American Rescue Plan. Montana is the first state to announce plans to leave the federal unemployment program. A few days later, South Carolina became the second, with Gov. Henry McMaster scheduling a withdrawal from the program by June 30. Our ruling""Montana is canceling unemployment because of a workforce shortage!"" reads a Facebook post. Gianforte announced that the state will withdraw from the federal unemployment assistance program established to help those out of work during the COVID-19 pandemic.

225,Madeline Heim,"""There’s no strings attached to that money that we’d be getting as an incentive to expand Medicaid.""","Republicans on the Wisconsin Legislature’s budget-writing committee dashed the hopes of their Democratic counterparts who were looking for the state to expand Medicaid, as Gov. Tony Evers proposed in his upcoming budget. Wisconsin is one of a dozen states that has not adopted the Medicaid expansion, which would lean on federal funds to broaden eligibility for the program to people with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level instead of the current 100%. Evers initially proposed the expansion in his first state budget, but the provision was quickly stripped out by Republican lawmakers. He tried again this year, though Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, told reporters in March he would not agree to it. On April 30, 2021, the Republican co-chairs of the budget-writing committee announced that the proposal would be among 280 items they plan to remove from the governor’s budget. It comes as a blow to Democratic lawmakers who have long pushed for the expansion, including state Sen. Jon Erpenbach, D-West Point. In a March 21, 2021 appearance on Capitol City Sunday, Erpenbach said it was time for Republicans to ""do the right thing"" and adopt the expansion to make tens of thousands more Wisconsinites eligible for BadgerCare. This time around, the expansion would come with more than $1 billion dollars in tax savings under a provision of the federal government’s pandemic relief legislation, meant to induce the 12 states that have not yet expanded health care coverage to do so. ""There’s no strings attached to that money that we’d be getting as an incentive to expand Medicaid,"" Erpenbach said. Is he correct? Let’s dig in. Are there ‘strings’ attached to these federal dollars? By ""no strings attached,"" the senator meant Wisconsin does not have to do anything besides expanding Medicaid to obtain those additional dollars, a spokesperson for his office said. The financial incentive to expand eligibility is a temporary 5% increase to the funding Wisconsin receives from the federal government to help pay for Medicaid, which is known as the federal medical assistance percentage, or FMAP. Currently, the state receives matching funds for about 60% of the costs of the program, according to a March 9, 2021, memo from the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. States that expanded Medicaid were eligible for enhanced matching funds, and the 5% increase that would come on top of that for two years. Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 18, 2023 in a Facebook postDocument shows that Hunter Biden paid Joe Biden $50,000 a month in rent.By Samantha Putterman • January 19, 2023The fiscal bureau estimates that Wisconsin would receive incentive funding that amounts to a total savings of a little over $1 billion dollars in the next biennium. If Republicans keep their current stance, Wisconsin will have given up more than $3 billion in federal funds by 2023. Whether Erpenbach is on target that there are no strings attached to that money, though, depends on your interpretation of strings.He’s correct that the state would not have to do anything besides expand the program to get the incentive money — though to be sure, the expansion would take time and effort to accomplish. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that Wisconsin would ""likely see fiscal gain"" under expansion, even though it was the only state to partially expand the program without accepting federal help. Republicans, on the other hand, see many strings attached to expanding Medicaid and thus receiving the bonus money. State Rep. Mark Born, R-Beaver Dam, a co-chair of the budget-writing committee, called the incentive money a ""federal bribe … to expand that welfare program"" and said private insurance gives people better health care coverage. (We rated False the claim about private insurance vs. Medicaid.) Republicans also worry about the consequences of pushing more costs onto health care providers who receive lower reimbursements from Medicaid than they do from private insurance, and have argued that the federal government could backtrack on its financial support of the program at a later date, causing the state to pick up more of the cost. And although the bonus money is estimated to offset states’ expansion costs for the first two years, once the FMAP returns to its regular rate, Wisconsin will be responsible for a portion of the program’s costs. Our ruling Erpenbach said there are ""no strings attached"" to the financial incentive Wisconsin could currently receive from the federal government to expand Medicaid. He’s right that there are no hidden strings attached to the money — that all the state would have to do is accept the expansion to receive it. Still, there are long-term responsibilities attached to that action, even if there are also long-term benefits. Our definition of Half True is that ""the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.""That fits here. window.gciAnalyticsUAID = 'PMJS-TEALIUM-COBRAND';window.gciAnalyticsLoadEvents = false;window.gciAnalytics.view({    'event-type': 'pageview',    'content-type': 'interactives',    'content-ssts-section': 'news',    'content-ssts-subsection': 'news:politics',    'content-ssts-topic': 'news:politics:politifactwisconsin',    'content-ssts-subtopic': ' news:politics:politifactwisconsin'});",Jon Erpenbach,"May 7, 2021",half-true

But Republicans argue that any increase would leave the United States at a competitive disadvantage internationally.On the May 2 edition of NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen defended the administration’s approach, suggesting that corporate profits are rising yet largely escaping taxation.""Right now, corporate income tax amounts to only 7% of total federal tax revenue, and corporate income has increased as a share"" of gross domestic product, Yellen said. ""This comes also in the context of global negotiations to try to stop a decades-long race to the bottom among countries in competing for business by lowering their corporate tax rates,"" she added. ""And we feel that will be successful.""Yellen was on target when she said corporate income taxes account for about 7% of federal tax revenues. But we wondered whether she was right to say that corporate income has increased as a share of GDP. The answer is yes over the long term, but not much in recent years.Economists we interviewed agreed that a reasonable metric for assessing Yellen’s claim is after-tax corporate profits as a percentage of GDP, which is calculated every year by the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis.The data shows that this figure has fluctuated between about 4% and 8% since the end of the Great Depression.!function(e,i,n,s){var t=""InfogramEmbeds"",d=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(""script"");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,""infogram-async""); If you leave out a three-year dip during the upheaval of the 2007-09 Great Recession, the percentage in recent years has stayed within an even narrower band.Featured Fact-checkJoe Bidenstated on January 12, 2023 in remarks at the White House“Take-home pay for workers is going up.”By Louis Jacobson • January 13, 2023Between 2004 to 2019, corporate profits have fluctuated between 6.5% and 7.7% of GDP.

229,Haley BeMiller,A new state agreement with Foxconn “will save Wisconsin taxpayers $2.77 billion.”,"Gov. Tony Evers has wasted no time touting Wisconsin’s new deal with Foxconn.The Democratic governor negotiated a new deal with the technology giant that would create 1,454 jobs and invest $672 million by 2026. In return, the company will receive a maximum of $80 million in tax subsidies — up to $37 million of which could be paid over the next two years. The plan dramatically scales back promises of 13,000 jobs and $10 billion in investment negotiated under former Republican Gov. Scott Walker that would have cost the state nearly $3 billion. But the company’s proposed LCD manufacturing facility in Mount Pleasant never came to fruition, and the company now seems to be shifting its focus to create a wider range of products on that campus. Evers contends the new agreement is a better outcome for Wisconsin. ""We fixed that agreement and found a better deal with Foxconn that will save Wisconsin taxpayers $2.77 billion while still bringing good, family-supporting jobs to Wisconsin,"" he tweeted on April 21, 2021.We’re going to focus on that number. Does the new Foxconn deal save taxpayers $2.77 billion?Breaking down the numbersWhen asked for evidence to support the governor’s claim, Evers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback pointed to the difference in tax credits between the new agreement and what Walker negotiated. The original plan would have provided Foxconn up to $2.85 billion in tax credits compared to $80 million under the new contract. The new deal includes $60.3 million in job and capital investment credits, plus another $19.7 million in performance credits if Foxconn meets and maintains job projections.If you subtract $80 million from $2.85 billion, you get the $2.77 billion Evers cited. That means when the governor is talking about savings, he’s really referring to how much the state will spend on subsidies. But how does that fit into the larger picture of taxpayer dollars?It’s first worth noting that Wisconsin has not yet given Foxconn any money. The Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. decided last year not to award tax credits to the company for work done in 2019 after determining it didn’t hire enough people. State officials expected the company to fall short for several more years and therefore didn’t plan to issue any subsidies during that time.Featured Fact-checkGlenn Youngkinstated on January 23, 2023 in a speech.Virginia tax receipts “in just the last four years alone have grown 50%.”By Warren Fiske • January 25, 2023Still, the state had to budget assuming Foxconn would meet its goals and be eligible for the money. For example, Cudaback said the 2019-21 state budget included roughly $211 million in case the company reached its job targets in the 2021 fiscal year. ""That’s more than $200M that couldn’t be spent on other priorities like schools, healthcare, broadband so Wisconsinites lost out on having that money invested in those areas because it had to be budgeted for Foxconn even if they did not ultimately qualify to receive those credits,"" she said.It’s part of the process for the 2021-23 budget, too. In an April 23, 2021 letter to chairmen of the Joint Finance Committee, Administration Secretary Joel Brennan asked that the spending plan reflect $37.4 million for Foxconn from 2021-23, based on the new deal.Taxpayer savings?Now, back to Evers’ original claim. It’s clear that Foxconn affected the state’s bottom line because officials had to set aside money for tax credits should the company meet its end of the agreement. But as Cudaback noted, that money theoretically could have been spent on something else if it wasn’t already earmarked — meaning it still could’ve hit taxpayers’ pocketbooks. The same is true for future savings, though none of that has been budgeted beyond the two-year spending plan in front of the Legislature.""Because of the renegotiated contract, the $2.77 billion saved — or, on average, nearly $200 million per biennium — can be allocated for other purposes in the state budget rather than being earmarked for a potential Foxconn payoff,"" Cudaback said.Evers’ claim also doesn’t reflect the possibility that Wisconsin may never have paid a dime in subsidies under the previous deal, based on the slow progress and shrinking Foxconn plans. So, in that respect, can one really save money that may never have been spent? That’s part of the issue when Evers and others make such claims about tax incentives.On the other side, if the original deal had been fulfilled — and Foxconn met all of the investment and job goals — the state would have paid more. And if a fully-realized massive LCD facility was the result, the state would have also seen a much bigger boon in jobs and economic development in return for those incentives. Our rulingIn a tweet, Evers said the new Foxconn deal ""will save Wisconsin taxpayers $2.77 billion.""The agreement does involve $2.77 billion less in state tax credits, which means taxpayers are on the hook for significantly less money. It’s important to note that the state had not paid subsidies to the company under the previous deal and wasn’t on track to do so for several years, so it’s possible much — or even all — of that never would have been paid. That said, the new contract also frees up funds that officials could funnel elsewhere. There’s no telling how this will affect future budgets, but if the state does choose to reallocate that money and spend it elsewhere, taxpayers won’t enjoy the savings Evers boasted about. Our definition for Half True is a statement that’s partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That fits here.window.gciAnalyticsUAID = 'PMJS-TEALIUM-COBRAND';window.gciAnalyticsLoadEvents = false;window.gciAnalytics.view({    'event-type': 'pageview',    'content-type': 'interactives',    'content-ssts-section': 'news',    'content-ssts-subsection': 'news:politics',    'content-ssts-topic': 'news:politics:politifactwisconsin',    'content-ssts-subtopic': ' news:politics:politifactwisconsin'});",Tony Evers,"April 30, 2021",half-true

Thom Tillis says President Joe Biden has failed to live up to his promises on immigration.The North Carolina Republican goes even further in a recent Fox News op-ed, arguing that Biden attempted to grant ""mass amnesty"" to immigrants in the country illegally.""One of his first acts in office was sending an immigration bill to Congress to grant mass amnesty to illegal immigrants,"" Tillis wrote.While the op-ed doesn’t specify the bill Tillis is referring to, his office cited the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021.So, is Tillis right about Biden’s bill? Most experts hesitate to label Biden’s bill as granting ""mass amnesty"" because it requires immigrants to meet certain criteria along their pathway to citizenship. And while the legislation does appear to open a wider gate than previous legalization efforts, the term ""amnesty"" is squishy, having been loosely defined and debated for many years.Biden’s bill is more lenient than the bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" proposal in the Senate that gained momentum in 2013. However, experts didn’t agree on whether it’s more lenient than a law enacted in 1986 by President Ronald Reagan, which is considered the modern standard for amnesty bills.Biden’s planBiden’s plan offers what the U.S. News & World Report described as a ""two-tier"" pathway to citizenship.A three-year path to citizenship would be available for some farmworkers, immigrants who arrived here illegally when they were children (known as ""Dreamers"") and people who currently benefit from a Temporary Protected Status designation. The expedited path could affect 3 million people, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.An eight-year path to citizenship would be available for all undocumented immigrants living in the United States at the start of 2021. In total, the bill could affect as many as 11 million immigrants. All immigrants would be required to pay taxes and pass background checks.The bill takes a more comprehensive approach to immigration than previous proposals because it also seeks to reduce visa backlogs, eliminate per-country admission caps, get rid of the one-year deadline for filing asylum claims and expand access to some visas.If enacted into law, it would fulfill Biden’s promise to create ""a roadmap to citizenship for the nearly 11 million people who have been living in and strengthening our country for years.""So, does it call for ""mass amnesty?""What is amnesty?Amnesty is a loose term that PolitiFact has explored dozens of times. We consulted six experts on the issue. They said the word is used so often and so excessively it’s almost devoid of a specific meaning. Does the term only apply to bills that offer blanket legalization?Do the criteria for legalization matter?Could it refer to any proposed pathway to citizenship?Tillis’ office says the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 meets the definition of amnesty outlined by a researcher for the Center for Immigration Studies, in a previous fact check about Tillis’ SUCCEED Act.Steven Camarota, whose group pushes for more limits on immigration, said amnesty basically refers to forgiveness for a crime (meaning Tillis’ SUCCEED Act could qualify as amnesty, despite having stringent citizenship requirements). It’s important to note though that the simple act of being in the United States illegally is not necessarily a crime.As PolitiFact has noted before, one legal definition of amnesty is that of ""a blanket abolition of an offense by the government, with the legal result that those charged or convicted have the charge or conviction wiped out.""Meanwhile, experts have told us the immigration law signed by President Reagan in 1986 often serves as the standard for what qualifies as amnesty.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 27, 2023 in a Facebook postU.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar is ""facing 40 years in prison and deportation after seven new crimes uncovered.""By Tom Kertscher • February 2, 2023The Immigration Reform and Control Act, or IRCA, said anyone who had been in the country continuously for about four years when the bill was signed into law, who paid a $185 fine and back taxes and who demonstrated ""good moral character"" would be granted legal status. Ultimately, the law allowed about 2.7 million people to get green cards.Comparing proposalsSo, how does Biden’s plan compare to other proposals?Experts say it’s more lenient than the so-called ""Gang of Eight"" proposal that attained notoriety in 2013 but never became law. That bill would have created a 13-year pathway to citizenship while also allocating billions of dollars to tighten border security.Is it more lenient than Reagan’s 1986 law? Some experts told us Biden’s law might actually be stricter. Others argue it’s unfair to compare the two, since the immigration issue has changed over the last 30 years.Biden’s proposal is ""much closer to the Gang of Eight bill than to Reagan’s amnesty,"" said David Leopold, a partner with Ulmer and Berne LLP.""But unlike those bills, Biden’s bill shifts the paradigm by providing a holistic approach,"" Leopold said. ""It addresses the root causes of migration from Central America by promoting rule of law, security and economic development, strengthening the regional humanitarian responses for refugees and asylum seekers and manages the border.""Edward Alden, the Bernard L. Schwartz senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, says experts have ""learned an awful lot since IRCA. ""The Reagan bill was premised on the notion that a one-time legalization would ‘solve’ the illegal immigration problem. But it paid no attention to what was going on in Mexico, and made no provisions for new legal channels, enhanced border security or employment verification,"" Alden said.Ann Lin, associate professor of public policy at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, is one of a couple experts who believe Biden’s bill might in some ways be stricter than Reagan’s law. Biden’s law ""does allow the primary applicant to apply for his/her immediate family dependants at the same time. In that way it is more generous than the 1986 law,"" Lin said. ""On the other hand, because there's a six year period (to become a permanent resident), those dependents are also likely to face a longer time period between application and permanent residence than the 1986 dependents.""""In some ways, the U.S. Citizenship Act is similar"" to Reagan’s law, said Kevin R. Johnson, an immigration law expert and dean of the University of California, Davis School of Law.""However, the proposed act also addresses legal immigration in ways that IRCA did not; the U.S. Citizenship Act has a better chance in my view of allowing many undocumented immigrants to legalize and to avoid the growth of a new undocumented population, like that which occurred after IRCA.""Biden’s plan would ""provide a quite wide path to legal status and eventually citizenship,"" said Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. It also ""arguably has fewer requirements than Reagan’s bill.""David Bier, an immigration researcher at the Cato Institute, agreed Biden’s bill ""has fewer requirements than the Reagan bill.""But Gelatt hesitated to use the term amnesty, noting that Biden’s plan requires applicants to ""pay a fee, undergo screening, and pay federal taxes."" While Reagan’s law required people to ""pay a fee, go through normal screenings, show proof of financial resources to ensure self sufficiency, and, to get a green card, show basic knowledge of English and U.S. history and government,"" the Biden bill includes ""the fee and background checks, but not documentation of self-sufficiency or the extra English/civics requirement.""Overall, Biden’s plan is ""not a completely open path to legal status,"" Gelatt said. ""But it is a broader and faster legalization pathway than others that have been proposed in recent years.""Our rulingTillis said: ""One of his first acts in office was sending an immigration bill to Congress to grant mass amnesty to illegal immigrants.""It’s fair to say that Biden’s plan would offer a wider path to citizenship than other proposals in recent years.

231,Amy Sherman,Says his administration’s efforts have led to more school reopenings.,"President Joe Biden took some credit for school reopenings, tying increases in in-person learning to his administration’s efforts to vaccinate educators and send money to schools.""Back in February, when many of our schools were fully or partially closed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the CDC — issued guidelines to help reopen our schools safely,"" Biden said April 21. ""Then, in March, Congress approved the American Rescue Plan to fund the safe reopening of our schools.""But educators were anxious about going back to the classroom without being vaccinated and many parents were nervous about sending their children, Biden said. ""So, on March the 2nd, I launched a program directing all states to make educators, school staff, school bus drivers, child care workers eligible for vaccination in every state so that schools and child care centers could open with a peace of mind,"" Biden said. ""Within a month, 80% had received at least one shot, and schools and child care centers all over the country are reopening."" It’s true that more schools have reopened from COVID-19-era closures in Biden’s first 100 days. But it’s hard to pinpoint how big a role the Biden administration played, as school communities were also influenced by other factors such as increased vaccinations, declines in cases, parent pressure and changes in state or local guidance. The Biden administration prioritized increasing vaccine supply to the states, which led more adults, including teachers, to be vaccinated. But with 13,000 school districts nationwide, there was no overarching explanation for why or when local and state officials decided to reopen schools.CDC guidance on school reopenings faced criticismEarly on, Biden and his administration gave conflicting messages about his school reopening goals. In December, he said he wanted to reopen the majority of schools during his first 100 days. But in January he narrowed that goal to apply to the majority of K-8 schools. The CDC issued recommendations on Feb. 12 that called for reopened schools to employ universal masking, keep everyone 6 feet apart, clean regularly, and require quarantining and contract tracing for new cases. The CDC also released a color-coded tool to guide reopening decisions based on weekly transmission levels. The controversial tool landed about 90% of the communities in the red zone due to high rates of transmission. By the guidelines, many middle and high schools would have had to close. Two public health experts concluded that the color-coded guidance would unnecessarily keep millions out of school.Some states such as Florida, which had been offering in person instruction since the fall, shrugged at the CDC’s guidance. And one month later, the CDC generally shrank the 6-foot rule to 3 feet, except in some middle and high schools where transmission is high. ""The move from 6 feet to 3 feet was absolutely an accelerator for school reopenings,"" said Dennis Roche, president of Burbio, a firm that is tracking data on school reopenings.Just before the CDC issued the 3-foot guidance, Burbio found that school districts in multiple states were spacing desks by 3 feet as they converted to traditional in-person instruction from hybrid systems in which children attended school both online and in person. That trend continued in March and April with some districts citing the 3-foot rule in their decisions to fully reopen in person.On March 2, Biden said he was directing states to prioritize vaccinating teachers. But by that point, more than 30 states had already done so — and some states that hadn’t prioritized teachers had reopened schools anyway.The CDC found through federal data and surveys that nearly 80% of pre-K through 12th grade school staff and childcare workers received at least their first shot by the end of March.Featured Fact-checkLauren Boebertstated on February 7, 2023 in a tweetJoe Biden closed schools during the COVID-19 pandemic.By Amy Sherman • February 8, 2023Biden also said the American Rescue Plan — which he signed into law in March — funded school reopening. While figures show almost $129 billion will go toward the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund, Biden’s statement seems to ignore that most of that money is directed to be spent after 2021. Schools have moved toward in-person learning throughout 2021There are two main ways to track weekly K-12 school openings: by school district or by students. The American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, publishes a tracker that monitors over 8,500 public school districts on whether they’re operating with fully remote, hybrid or fully in-person learning. According to its metrics, about 5% of districts were fully remote as of mid-April, compared with about 20% a couple days before Biden took office. Burbio, which tracks about 1,200 school districts, found that about 6% of students were in fully remote schools as of late April, compared with about half of students a couple days before Biden took office.The trackers show that schools have steadily moved toward in-person instruction in 2021. But we couldn’t find any evidence of a significant shift to in-person learning that was specifically tied to the CDC’s February guidance, Biden’s announcement that all teachers were eligible for vaccines, or the promise of American Rescue Plan money. ""The real answer is there was a lot of things pushing schools to reopen during this period and all sort of tailwinds for reopening, making it pretty hard to figure out which one is the one to look at,"" said Nat Malkus, an expert on K-12 education at the American Enterprise Institute.COVID-19 cases were declining in areas. Vaccinations were increasing. Parents were pressing schools to open. Pediatricians and health experts were urging a return to school. And some governors were advocating for more in-person instruction.Biden’s efforts probably helped some districts move toward reopening, Malkus said, but ""as far as the overall trend, I don’t think you can give the Biden administration a lot of credit for driving it."" Sean R. Gill, a research analyst at the Center on Reinventing Public Education at the University of Washington, said he believes the actions of states and governors had more of an impact than Biden’s moves. ""Even in California, they made some new state funds contingent on being open for in-person or hybrid learning,"" he said.Linda Darling-Hammond, president of the state board of education in California, credited both Biden and state action with fueling reopenings there. The dramatic increase in vaccine supply under Biden’s watch ""made a big difference because many many districts were waiting on vaccines to get to teachers to reopen schools,"" she said. Similarly, school leaders were able to start counting on money that would be coming.Our rulingBiden says his administration’s efforts have led to more school reopenings.Biden cited guidelines issued by the CDC, his announcement to prioritize vaccinating educators and the passage of the American Rescue Plan.We found it’s difficult to pinpoint the factors that drove more schools to reopen in 2021. While some of the Biden administration’s actions helped, many states and schools were already moving toward more in-person learning when those initiatives were announced. Other factors also played a role, including COVID-19 infection rates, overall vaccination rates, pressure from parents and decisions by local and state officials. We rate this statement Half True.RELATED: Evaluating President Joe Biden’s first 100 days in officeRELATED: Capito correct that school funding in Biden’s relief bill extends through 2028RELATED: COVID-19 far less dangerous to kids, but wrong to say they ‘are not affected’",Joe Biden,"April 27, 2021",half-true

One reason schools require masks is to try to prevent kids from giving the virus to other people, which can happen even if kids become infected but don’t show symptoms.Moreover, because adults are being immunized and new variants of the virus are more likely to infect children, ""children are rapidly becoming the major reservoir of COVID in the United States,"" said Dr. Mark Schleiss, professor of pediatrics at the University of Minnesota Medical School. Clip shows woman addressing school boardThe two-minute video clip was widely shared by Facebook users, including conservative commentator and Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren, who has 4.8 million Facebook followers.

However, there is an urgent need to collect more data on longer-term impacts of the pandemic on children, including ways the virus may harm the long-term physical health of infected children, as well as its emotional and mental health effects,"" the report said.Featured Fact-checkScott Adamsstated on January 23, 2023 in an Instagram postPeople not vaccinated against COVID-19 “came out the best.""By Tom Kertscher • January 26, 2023Most children who become infected have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, but some can get severely ill, according to the CDC and other researchers. And while COVID-19 presents less risk to children and teens generally — and children under 10 appear less likely than adolescents to become infected — children can get sick and can spread the virus, even without symptoms, according to the CDC.The CDC is also investigating ""a rare but serious medical condition"" associated with COVID-19 in children called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome, a condition where different body parts can become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. in Children. ""We do not yet know what causes MIS-C and who is at increased risk for developing it,"" the CDC says.Why children react differently to the coronavirus isn’t yet clear, according to the Mayo Clinic.COVID-19 and schoolsEvidence indicates that ""in-person learning in schools has not been associated with substantial"" transmission of COVID-19 in the community, and that staff-to-staff transmission is more common than transmission from students to staff, staff to student, or student to student, according to the CDC.The CDC says multiple studies have shown that transmission within school settings is typically lower than, or at least similar to, levels of community transmission — ""when prevention strategies are in place in schools.""As we’ve reported, masks are most effective as ""source control,"" which means preventing infected people from spreading the virus to other people. Respiratory droplets carrying the virus are expelled into the air when infected people cough, talk, sneeze or breathe. These droplets quickly evaporate and shrink to become tiny airborne particles. But if an infected person is wearing a mask, it will catch and contain the larger droplets in the humid space between the person’s mouth and the mask. In this environment, droplets take nearly a hundred times as long to transform into airborne particles. So, masks reduce the spread of infectious particles.This makes a meaningful difference when everyone is wearing masks. If you’re the only one wearing a mask in a public location, it won’t necessarily protect you from being infected. But if everybody is wearing a mask, your odds of infection will go down by quite a bit. Public health experts have based their guidance on a variety of scientific studies: systematic reviews, ecological studies and laboratory studies. Our rulingA woman in a video clip widely shared on Facebook stated that children ages 5 to 9 ""are not affected by"" the coronavirus.Most children who get COVID-19 have mild or no symptoms; severe illness is rare.But more than 3.6 million children have tested positive and at least 297 have died.

""And we have 23% of all the lead pipe leads in America in the Chicagoland area.

That ended when lead service lines were banned by the federal government in 1986, years after their use began to decline in many other places.Biden’s proposal — dubbed the American Jobs Plan — seeks to eliminate lead pipes by allocating $45 billion to several U.S. Environmental Protection Agency programs.So, we wondered if Chicago and its surrounding area really account for nearly a quarter of the nation’s lead pipes, as Durbin claimed.Both Chicago and Illinois stand out, but national data is limitedWhile Chicago is unique when it comes to its number of known lead service lines, experts told us it’s tough to determine the accuracy of Durbin’s statistic because no national inventory exists.""The vast majority of cities don't know exactly how many lead service lines exist or where they are located,"" said Maura Allaire, an assistant professor of water economics and environmental policy at the University of California, Irvine.Durbin spokesman Joe LaPaille told us in an email that Durbin ""misspoke on CNN and said ‘Chicago’ instead of Illinois.""""However, Chicago does make up a large portion of lead service lines in Illinois, and has more lead service lines than any other city,"" LaPaille said.LaPaille said Durbin got his statistic using figures highlighted by the EPA and the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmentalist non-profit group that has pushed for Biden’s administration to expedite the removal of lead service lines.Featured Fact-checkRon DeSantisstated on January 17, 2023 in a press conference""Almost every study now has said with these new boosters, you're more likely to get infected with the bivalent booster.""By Yacob Reyes • January 20, 2023The EPA’s website offers an estimated range for the number of lead service lines in the country: six to 10 million. Meanwhile, a press release from the Natural Resources Defense Council put the range for Illinois between 730,000 and 1.4 million. To get to 23%, Durbin took the high end of the state estimate and divided it by the low end of the national estimate, LaPaille said.The EPA’s estimate of more than six million is based on survey data published in 2016 by the American Water Works Association, the group representing water utility operators. The agency’s high-end estimate of 10 million comes from survey work conducted by the same group in the 1980s, and was adjusted down to 9.3 million in a recent update for federal drinking water regulations.The 730,000 estimate also comes from the water utilities group, according to Jeremy Orr, senior attorney for the NRDC’s clean water initiative. The 1.4 million figure, on the other hand, comes from more recent data reported by water system operators to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. Illinois is one of four states to require operators to report on the material of service lines in their system.To reach 1.4 million for the state, the NRDC included both known lead service lines and lines of unknown material that may be lead. Another category included in the state EPA dataset allows water systems to separately list lines of unknown material that are not lead.The number of lead lines and unknown lines that may be lead in water systems in Cook County, where Chicago is located, and its five surrounding counties is somewhat lower — but not by much: 1 million out of the state’s 1.4 million total are reported in the region.The 23% estimate Durbin reached for the state’s share ""is not unreasonable,"" said Tom Neltner, a chemicals policy director at the Environmental Defense Fund who has analyzed Illinois’ approach to developing its inventory.""But it is difficult to be sure because the national number is so uncertain,"" Neltner added.Taking the 1.4 million pipes in Illinois that are or may be lead and dividing that by the EPA’s updated upper-range estimate of 9.3 million, for instance, lowers the state’s share to 16% and the Chicago area’s to 11%.Our rulingDurbin said ""we have 23% of all the lead pipe leads in America in the Chicagoland area.""His office told us he meant to refer to the entire state, rather than just Chicagoland. Most lead pipes in Illinois are found in Chicago and surrounding counties, however, so Durbin isn’t far off.The bigger issue with his claim comes in its comparison to the nation. Unlike Illinois, which requires water systems to report how many pipes are or may be lead, there’s no national inventory to use for comparison. The survey estimates cited by the federal government are broad, and both Illinois’ and Chicago’s estimated share of those totals varies considerably depending on which end of the range is used.We rate Durbin’s claim Half True.HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.",Richard Durbin,"April 18, 2021",half-true

235,Jill Terreri,"""In fact, the data coming in from some states that have legalized marijuana is that they actually see a decrease in use over time, particularly among young people.""","New York state legislators and Gov. Andrew Cuomo have approved a law allowing recreational use, production and sale of marijuana for people over age 21. State Sen. Liz Krueger, a Democrat from Manhattan, has long sponsored legislation to legalize marijuana. During the Senate debate, she said: ""In fact, the data coming in from some states that have legalized marijuana is that they actually see a decrease in use over time, particularly among young people.""Given concerns about whether young people will be more inclined to use marijuana, even if it is legal only for people age 21 and older, we wondered if reliable data supported Krueger’s point. What the studies say We reached out to Krueger’s office, and a spokesman, Justin Flagg, sent us several studies. In Colorado, the legal sale of recreational marijuana began in 2014. Four years later, Colorado’s Division of Criminal Justice published a study about the effects of legalization, and found that between 2005 and 2017 the proportion of Colorado high school students reporting using marijuana ever in their lifetime had modest fluctuations but remained statistically unchanged. Also, the study found no statistically significant difference between Colorado student responses compared to national data. The proportion of students reporting they had used marijuana in the last 30 days was also stable, with no significant changes, from 2005 to 2017. A year after that report, the Healthy Kids Colorado Survey found that youth marijuana use had ticked up slightly from the previous survey, and was up less than 1 percentage point from just before legal sales began. Survey authors reported there had been no significant change since 2005. Other studies also suggested no change in youth use in Colorado. In 2018, a study in Prevention Science showed that for high school students there were no significant changes in marijuana use when they were asked if they had used it ever, or in the last 30 days.  In Washington state, which legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, a study from the Rand Corp. and others published in JAMA Pediatrics in 2018 found a small decrease in youth use, but warned that more data is needed to identify long-term trends. Marijuana use dropped a small, but statistically significant amount among eighth graders and 10th graders in Washington state following legalization, in 2014 and 2016, compared with 2010 and 2012, researchers wrote. Among eighth graders, prevalence of marijuana use fell from 9.8 percent to 7.3 percent. Among 10th graders, use fell from 19.8 percent to 17.8 percent. No changes were reported among 12th graders.A 2019 study in the American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse found that there were not significant shifts in use among youth overall in places that had decriminalized marijuana, ""but predicted significant declines in marijuana use among 14-year olds and those of Hispanic and other ancestry (1.7-4.4 percentage points), and significant increases among white adolescents (1.6 percentage points).""In a research letter published in JAMA Pediatrics in 2019, researchers wrote that based on their analysis of surveys in states that had legalized recreational adult-use marijuana, youth use ""may actually"" decline. Recreational marijuana laws were associated with an 8 percent decrease in the likelihood of marijuana use and a 9 percent decrease in the likelihood of frequent marijuana use.   Study author D. Mark Anderson, an associate professor of economics at Montana State University, told PolitiFact earlier this year that researchers interpreted their results as consistent with the argument that as licensed dispensaries that require proof of age replace drug dealers, marijuana becomes more difficult for teens to obtain.    What experts sayWe talked to three academic researchers who study marijuana legalization, and they all said that there is not a definitive link between legalization and lower use by minors. Magdalena Cerda, an associate professor at New York University Grossman School of Medicine, was a co-author of the Rand study. That study found a decrease in adolescent marijuana use after legalization, but it didn’t have a comparison group, therefore it’s unclear whether the decrease was due to legalization, or whether, in the absence of legalization, the decrease would have been larger, Cerda said.Another of Cerda’s studies, published in 2019 in JAMA Psychiatry, found no change in use among adolescents, but a potential small increase in cannabis use disorder, particularly among adolescents who had previously used marijuana. Based on the JAMA Psychiatry study and the JAMA Pediatrics study, Cerda said, ""I think this suggests that we don’t see an increase in use among the general population of adolescents in the short-term aftermath following legalization."" As for problematic use among existing users, the finding is very preliminary and requires further study, she said.     Katharine Neill Harris, a fellow in drug policy at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University, said that youth use has been on a decline since the early 2000s, before any state legalized recreational marijuana. In looking at youth use since legalization, Colorado’s data is best, and that it shows that marijuana use by high school students has been stable, she said. Featured Fact-checkRobert Orttstated on January 20, 2023 in in a news conferenceIf New York’s proposed limits on natural gas in buildings take effect, the grid today can’t handle the increased electric load.By Jill Terreri Ramos • February 8, 2023In states that have legalized, increases or decreases have been very small, Harris said. Meanwhile, among adults, marijuana use is increasing nationwide, including in states that have legalized, she said.She pointed us to a study published in July 2020 from the University of Washington, which showed that reductions in teen use could be slowed by legalization, meaning that teen use could have decreased more without legalization. The Washington study followed a smaller group of young people over time, which offers a different analysis than point-in-time survey data from a larger group. It’s still too early to make any definitive conclusions about whether legalization impacts youth use, she said.  Jonathan P. Caulkins, a past co-director of the Rand Drug Policy Research Center and a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, said there are 15 states and multiple indicators from which advocates can pick statistics. The overall finding, Caulkins said, is that legalization for adults was accompanied by stable rates for youth overall, but youth rates of risky behaviors such as smoking, drinking, getting drunk, and other indicators are all down. ""Some of us guess that legalization has offset or erased what otherwise would have been progress,"" he said. Still, the effect of legalization is small, if any, he said. The reasons for this are that legalization was only for adults, not kids, and that marijuana was already widely available even where it was prohibited and that in many states, legalization came after medical marijuana was permitted in brick and mortar stores, broadening legal access. ""It has been less bad for kids than we feared it might be, and it is definitely not bad and might even be level, but it is just not right to say that a fair and comprehensive look at the data concludes that kids have been helped by legalization in that way,"" Caulkins said.  PolitiFact has fact-checked similar claims. In 2019, PolitiFact found that adult use in Colorado through 2017 rose, as it had been trending before legalization, while youth use remained the same or decreased a little.  Also in 2019, PolitiFact Illinois rated a claim that ""steady decreases in youth use"" in states that have legalized Mostly False, based on a lack of evidence from states that have legalized. In March, PolitiFact Wisconsin issued a Half True ruling to a claim that youth usage has gone down in states that have legalized, citing the JAMA Pediatrics study and other sources. Our rulingKrueger said data from ""some states"" that have legalized shows a decrease in use over time, particularly among young people. The data shows youth usage has been stable, or with a decrease according to some research. Other research has shown, meanwhile, that legalization could actually thwart a downward trend in youth usage, and that problematic use among teens could increase after legalization. Krueger’s statement could leave the listener with the impression that there is a relationship between legalization and lower rates of youth marijuana usage.Some research might support this, but certainly not all of it, and researchers warn that more study is necessary.  We rate this Half True.",Liz Krueger,"• April 9,",half-true

The Biden administration suspended that policy for children in January, and now allows children who cross the border alone to remain in the U.S. while they await immigration court proceedings. U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed to us that the 2,600 unaccompanied minors in U.S. Customs and Border Protection custody in June 2019 was the highest such figure under Trump. The number was 5,160, essentially twice as many as at the peak under Trump, when Abbott made his claim.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 27, 2023 in a Facebook postU.S. Rep.

238,Haley BeMiller,"""Over the past decade, drug prices have risen at three times the rate of inflation.""","U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin is revisiting a problem she’s fought against more than once during her time in office: high drug prices. The Wisconsin Democrat — joined by colleagues on both sides of the aisle — reintroduced legislation on March 23, 2021 that would require manufacturers to disclose and justify their decisions to increase prescription drug costs. Baldwin previously co-sponsored the bill with the late U.S. Sen. John McCain and highlighted it during her 2018 reelection bid. The latest announcement from Baldwin and U.S. Sens. Mike Braun, R-Indiana, Tina Smith, D-Minnesota, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, painted an urgent picture of ""skyrocketing"" prices and argued the bill would ensure transparency for taxpayers. ""Over the past decade, drug prices have risen at three times the rate of inflation,"" the news release stated.Does this claim add up?The cost of prescriptionsWhen asked for evidence to support the statement, Baldwin’s office pointed to two studies that analyzed the relationship between drug prices and inflation. A study published in March 2020 looked at the prices of branded medications from 2007 to 2018 and found list prices increased by 159% over that time period and 9.1% per year. Researchers also determined that the drugs’ net prices — adjusted for discounts and rebates — increased 60%, or an average of 4.5% per year. That was 3.5 times faster than the inflation rate, the study noted, which lines up with the figure Baldwin cited. But researchers didn’t touch on generic drugs, which make up the lion’s share of the market — some 90% of prescriptions.That said, despite accounting for just 10% of all prescriptions, brand-name drugs make up about 75% of all drug spending, according to recent congressional testimony from Aaron Kesselheim, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.The same is true within the Medicaid program. According to a 2019 analysis from the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission, spending on brand-name drugs increased from 76.6% to 80.5% from 2014 to 2017 even though generics exceeded 80% of all drug claims.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 18, 2023 in a Facebook postDocument shows that Hunter Biden paid Joe Biden $50,000 a month in rent.By Samantha Putterman • January 19, 2023""There are a lot of essential medicines that are still available only in brand names,"" Kesselheim told PolitiFact Wisconsin.Another analysis cited by Baldwin’s office from the Kaiser Family Foundation looked at changes in pricing for both brand-name and generic drugs in a single year. According to that study, the prices of half of all drugs covered under Medicare Part D — which amounts to more than 1,600 medications — increased more than the rate of inflation from July 2018 to July 2019. The median price hike among those drugs was 6.4% — more than 3 times the inflation rate of 1.8% that year. Researchers also determined that 45 medications used by more than 1 million enrollees — including 38 generics — outpaced inflation with a median price increase of 5.7%.So, that part of the study bolsters Baldwin’s claim. But the Kaiser study also found the increase in cost of 419 drugs was below inflation, while another 1,241 saw price decreases. And since that study limited its timeframe to one year, it doesn’t speak to the decade-long trend Baldwin referenced. Our rulingIn a news release, Baldwin and her Senate colleagues claimed ""over the past decade, drug prices have risen at three times the rate of inflation.""One study that lines up with Baldwin’s claim doesn’t account for generic drugs, and the other only looks at one year of cost increases.

239,Louis Jacobson,The proposal by President Joe Biden would put the U.S. “No. 2 in the world” for the highest corporate tax rate.,"The White House and congressional Republicans are squaring off over President Joe Biden’s infrastructure proposal, with both sides zeroing in on the corporate tax rate, a major source of funding for the new initiatives.Biden is proposing to raise the federal tax rate on corporations from 21% to 28%. That’s below the 35% rate that was in place prior to the tax law signed by President Donald Trump in 2017. But Republicans say that an increase to 28% would leave the United States at a competitive disadvantage to other nations with lower corporate tax rates. (Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a moderate Democrat whose support will be needed to pass any such bill, has already said he opposes any increase beyond 25%.)In an April 4 appearance on Fox News Sunday, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., reiterated the argument that the United States can’t afford to increase its corporate tax rate to 28%.""If we went back to 28%, I think we'd be No. 2 in the world in corporate taxes,"" Blunt said.Blunt has a point, but he left out some important wording.To make the most complete country-to-country comparisons, experts generally look at a country’s national corporate tax rate plus a weighted average of tax rates for its sub-national units. (In the case of the U.S., that would be states that have corporate income tax rates.)While the national rate under Biden’s plan would be 28%, experts have calculated that the national plus sub-national rate would average out to 32.34% under the proposal.Every year, the Tax Foundation collects the corporate tax rates for essentially every nation and subdivision. By their calculations, Biden’s proposed combined corporate tax rate would rank 20th in the world. ""Looking at the highest corporate tax rates all around the world, this is incorrect,"" said Elke Asen, a policy analyst with the Tax Foundation. Eric Toder, the co-director of the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, agreed with this assessment.Here’s a list of the top 25 corporate tax rates in the world if Biden’s proposal was enacted as is. (The Tax Foundation’s list includes some autonomous and quasi-autonomous regions that levy their own corporate tax rate, such as Puerto Rico and American Samoa, which are U.S. territories.)Featured Fact-checkAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezstated on January 27, 2023 in an interview with reporters“The largest contributor to the debt ceiling, or to our deficit, has been the Trump tax cuts.”By Louis Jacobson • February 1, 2023!function(e,i,n,s){var t=""InfogramEmbeds"",d=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(""script"");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,""infogram-async""); But there’s an important caveat: Most of the countries with higher corporate tax rates than Biden’s proposal are relatively small economies.

That would rank in the top one-fifth of OECD nations.Our rulingBlunt said Biden’s proposal would put the U.S. ""No. 2 in the world"" for the highest corporate tax rate.Strictly speaking, Blunt is incorrect: If Biden’s proposal is enacted as is, at least 19 countries would still have a higher corporate tax rate, when national and sub-national tax rates are combined. However, with the exception of Brazil, these are mostly small economies.If you instead compare the United States to other advanced industrialized nations, Blunt has a point: The combined national and sub-national tax rate under Biden’s proposal would be higher than any other OECD country, and the 28% national tax rate alone would rank in the top one-fifth of OECD countries.We rate the statement Half True.",Roy Blunt,"April 6, 2021",half-true

One of them is Rep. Alex Mooney, R-W.Va.The bill, which passed the House on a mostly party-line vote and awaits action in the Senate, includes proposals on voter registration, absentee voting, in-person voting, campaign finance and ethics related to federal elections.In a press release issued March 3, Mooney explained why he voted against the bill, which he dismissed as the ""For the Politicians Act.""""It mandates practices nationwide which are prone to fraud, such as ballot harvesting, universal mail-in voting and same-day registration,"" Mooney said in the news release. He argued that, collectively, ""this power grab would undermine ballot integrity and restrict the voice of each individual citizen in our election process.""PolitiFact’s national staff has previously fact-checked portions of this statement. Overall, Mooney’s statement gets some things right, some things wrong, and some in between. We’ll take a look at each. (Mooney’s office did not respond to inquiries for this article.)Claim: H.R. 1 mandates ""ballot harvesting.""This is partially accurate but needs context. ""Ballot harvesting"" isn’t an official legal term, but it generally refers to someone collecting completed and sealed absentee ballots on behalf of others and then submitting them. Many states’ current laws allow individuals to collect ballots on behalf of others, sometimes with certain restrictions.H.R. 1 doesn’t require ballots to be collected this way, but requires states to allow it in some forms. It says that states ""shall permit a voter to designate any person"" to return their sealed absentee ballot, as long as the person doesn’t get paid based on the number of ballots returned. It would prevent states from putting a limit on how many ballots any person could return on behalf of others.Claim: H.R. 1 mandates ""universal mail-in voting.""This is False.The phrase used by Mooney, ""universal mail-in voting,"" is not a commonly used term; more common is ""all-mail elections."" In all-mail elections, ballots are automatically mailed to every registered voter. ""The voter marks the ballot, puts it in a secrecy envelope or sleeve and then into a separate mailing envelope, signs an affidavit on the exterior of the mailing envelope, and returns the package via mail or by dropping it off,"" according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.This system is used in Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington state and Utah. In addition, California has moved to temporarily extend its use of all-mail voting after adopting it during the coronavirus pandemic.H.R. 1 doesn’t force any state to adopt the all-mail system or send out ballots automatically.Featured Fact-checkPublic Interest Legal Foundationstated on January 18, 2023 in a reportIn California, there were “10 million mail ballots unaccounted for” in the November midterm election.By Jeff Cercone • January 26, 2023Rather, the bill would make it easier for registered voters who choose to cast their ballot by mail. The bill requires states to give everyone access to voting by mail if they want to use it.The law says that states cannot ""impose any additional conditions or requirements"" on an eligible voter’s ability to cast an absentee ballot by mail in federal elections. In addition, the bill nixes state laws requiring identification for mail ballots beyond a voter’s signature, such as  notarized statements.The bill allows states to set a ""reasonable deadline"" for requesting a mail ballot and returning it to elections officials. And it requires states to treat a mail-in ballot application for one election to stand as a default preference for all subsequent federal elections.There’s no question that these H.R. 1 provisions set new standards for access to mail ballots. But none of these provisions amount to ""universal mail-in"" voting. Voting by mail would be an option for voters, not a requirement.Claim: H.R. 1 mandates ""same-day registration.""This is accurate. A little under half the states already offer some form of same-day voter registration, in which individuals can cast a ballot on the same day they register. H.R. 1  would mandate that states allow any eligible individual to register to vote on the day of a federal election and cast a ballot that day. People who are already registered could revise their voter registration information and still vote that day.Are these practices ""prone to fraud""?Practices such as ballot harvesting, same-day registration and mail-in voting are already used in some states. Even so, there is no evidence of widespread fraud in the U.S. election systemBetween Election Day and late November, PolitiFact fact-checked more than 80 misleading or false claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election.

""One went to jail and one is running for office again in this election.""A fact check of Carroll Foy’s statement finds she’s right on the FBI probes, but wrong in saying one of the governors was locked up.Republican Bob McDonnell was investigated by the FBI, and his case had enormous consequences. Ten days after his term expired in 2014, McDonnell was indicted on federal corruption charges for accepting $165,000 in gifts and loans from businessman Jonnie Williams Sr.. In exchange, authorities said McDonnell used the influence of the governor’s office to promote Williams’ diet supplement business. McDonnell was found guilty on 11 counts of corruption and, in January 2015, was sentenced to two years in prison by Senior U.S. District Judge James Spencer.But contrary to Carroll Foy’s statement, McDonnell never spent a day in prison. He remained free through his appeals and, in June 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously vacated his conviction, saying some of the courtesies McDonnell gave Williams, such as setting up meetings with state officials who were in a position to help Williams’ business, did not qualify as an ""official act"" of corruption despite McDonnell’s acceptance gifts. Prosecutors declined to try McDonnell again under a more narrow definition of corruption.Sharon Yang, a spokesperson for Carroll Foy, said the candidate ""misspoke"" in saying McDonnell went to jailDemocrat Terry McAuliffe was also investigated by the FBI during his gubernatorial term from 2013-2017, but he was never accused of wrongdoing - an important fact Carroll Foy omits.

245,Eric Litke,"Judge Jeff Davis ""spent years defending a convicted cop killer"" and ""tried to get him off the hook.""","A typically low-profile race for state appeals court has taken a contentious and partisan turn due to a series of attack ads against the incumbent.Judge Jeff Davis was appointed to the District II Court of Appeals by Gov. Tony Evers in 2019. One of the people who unsuccessfully applied for that position, Muskego Municipal Judge Shelley Grogan, is now running against Davis in the April 6 election.Though the position is nonpartisan, the race has taken a distinctly partisan flavor as ads from Grogan and a third-party group link Davis and Evers in the obligatory ominous voiceover. An ad running on WTMJ and WISN radio the weeks leading up to the election touted Grogan’s law enforcement endorsements, then said this:""Jeff Davis just can’t be trusted to keep our communities safe. In fact, Jeff Davis spent years defending a convicted cop killer, who murdered a correctional officer in cold blood. The killer was sentenced to death row, and Jeff Davis tried to get him off the hook.""It’s a classic attack ad narrative — and one that screams for additional context.Let’s check out the situation referenced here and whether the ad gets it right.The caseIn 1987, William Van Poyck and Frank Valdes attacked a prison transport in West Palm Beach, Florida, attempting to free a convicted killer being taken for skin cancer treatment.Van Poyck told a jury that he masterminded the ambush, according to the Palm Beach Post. And one of the prison guards said Van Poyck held a gun to his head and pulled the trigger, but the gun misfired.The other guard, Fred Griffis — a decorated U.S. Army Ranger who served in Vietnam — was shot and killed. Van Poyck and Valdes both claimed at trial that the other had killed Griffis, but both were convicted and sentenced to death since being part of a deadly crime is sufficient under Florida law.Van Poyck spent decades on death row before he was executed by lethal injection in June 2013.Davis’s roleThroughout most of the post-conviction appeals process, Van Poyck was represented by Davis, who was a civil litigator with Quarles & Brady at the time.Davis was urged to take the case as a young associate by the American Bar Association, which has a program to recruit pro bono counsel from large law firms for complex cases, his campaign website says. Davis said in an email he ""thought it would be a good experience for me in developing trial and appellate skills.""Davis ended up representing Van Poyck — largely on his own — from 1992 until the execution. He asked to be removed from the case in the late 1990s when expected support from a federal resource center disappeared, but a judge denied the request and Davis didn’t ask again.Featured Fact-checkPublic Interest Legal Foundationstated on January 18, 2023 in a reportIn California, there were “10 million mail ballots unaccounted for” in the November midterm election.By Jeff Cercone • January 26, 2023""As time went on and my institutional knowledge of the case accumulated, I felt it would be entirely inappropriate and possibly constitute client abandonment if I were to do so,"" Davis said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.Davis said he pursued the case in hopes of having the death sentence reduced to life in prison. Despite the tone of the ad, it’s hardly an activity Davis sought to hide. He detailed it in the letter he wrote to Evers seeking the judicial appointment he eventually received.In a letter to the Florida governor seeking a last-minute stay of execution in 2013, Davis said Valdes’ widow had recently provided a sworn statement that Valdes — who was beaten to death by prison guards in 1999 —  confessed to her that he killed the guard, not Van Poyck. Davis said jurors had indicated in affidavits their verdict ""would have been different had they known the truth."" The governor declined to intervene, however.Reviewing the adWith that context, let’s circle back to the ad.Grogan says Davis ""spent years defending a cop killer."" The ad goes on to reference the death of a correctional officer, but it exaggerates a bit on the ""cop killer"" line. That’s a term traditionally applied only to police officers.The ad also says Davis ""tried to get (Van Poyck) off the hook."" Again, this overreaches. Davis was certainly seeking to change the sentence from death row to life behind bars, but he wasn’t seeking to overturn the conviction — the impression listeners could be left with from the ad’s choice of words.In short, Davis was filling a role required by the American criminal justice system.Michael O’Hear, a professor at Marquette University Law School, said it’s important to recognize the need for good legal representation even for people accused of the most serious crimes. He noted hundreds of people have ultimately been exonerated in serious cases like murder and rape through evidence solicited and presented by their attorneys.""People who are accused of serious crimes have a constitutional right to competent legal representation,"" O’Hear said in an email. ""The right to legal representation may be most important for those individuals who have been accused of committing the most heinous offenses.""The District II Court of Appeals, based in Waukesha, is a four-judge panel that hears cases passed up from circuit courts in Calumet, Fond du Lac, Green Lake, Kenosha, Manitowoc, Ozaukee, Racine, Sheboygan, Walworth, Washington, Waukesha and Winnebago counties. It’s a noteworthy position since it can be a stepping stone to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, as it was for Justice Brian Hagedorn, whose former post Davis and Grogan are seeking.Our rulingIn an attack ad, Grogan said Davis ""spent years defending a convicted cop killer"" and ""tried to get him off the hook.""Davis did indeed spend 21 years working on the Van Poyck case, seeking to have his sentence reduced from the death penalty to life in prison.But the ad exaggerates on key points. ""Cop killer"" isn’t quite an accurate description of a man convicted of killing a prison guard. And the ""off the hook"" phrasing overstates the situation since the appeals weren’t seeking to overturn the conviction, just the death penalty.Most notably, the overall tone of the ad implies something nefarious about the representation when Davis was filling a role mandated by the judicial system — and doing it for free.We define Half True as a statement that ""is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.""

247,Brandon Mulder,"""We began seeing the increase in unaccompanied minors going back to last April 2020. This is not something that happened as a result of Joe Biden becoming president.”","U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, joined CNN host Jake Tapper on March 14 to defend President Joe Biden’s response to the influx of unaccompanied children at the southern border and shift blame to the Trump administration. The number of unaccompanied children encountered by Border Patrol increased sharply earlier this year, from 5,858 in January to 9,457 in February — a 61% increase, according to federal data. It’s the largest one month percentage increase since U.S. Customs and Border Protection began reporting the data in 2010. ""Is this a crisis?"" Tapper asked Escobar.  ""There is no doubt, Jake, that what we're seeing today is an enormous challenge,"" Escobar replied, adding that the uptick is a consequence of the Trump administration’s immigration policies that the Biden administration is ""is working day and night"" to amend.  ""We began seeing the increase in unaccompanied minors going back to last April 2020. This is not something that happened as a result of Joe Biden becoming president,"" Escobar said. ""We saw the increases dating back almost a year. And this was during the Trump administration."" The growing number of people arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border has become a  partisan issue — Democrats blaming the uptick on Trump policies while Republicans blame it on changes the Biden administration has implemented. During a March 21 interview on ABC News, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas made comments similar to Escobar’s. ""Why is it especially challenging and difficult now? Because the entire system under United States law that has been in place throughout administrations of both parties was dismantled in its entirety by the Trump administration,"" Mayorkas said.Gov. Greg Abbott, on the other hand, has blamed Biden’s ""reckless open border policies"" for the ""surge in border crossings and cartel activity.""Migration patterns are complex and driven by numerous factors beyond changes in U.S. immigration policy, experts say. Is Escobar accurate in saying that increases in the number of unaccompanied minors arriving at the border dates back to the Trump administration? And is she correct to say that these increases are not ""a result of Joe Biden becoming president""? Unaccompanied minors in 2020The first part of Escobar’s statement is accurate — the number of unaccompanied minors encountered at the border has been increasing since April 2020. But this trend generally follows seasonal migration patterns. Migration numbers typically peak in the spring, usually in May, and decrease in the late summer.  But in 2020, the steady rise continued through the winter. According to Art Arthur, a former immigration judge and a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think-tank that advocates for low immigration numbers, the steady rise in migrants through June, July and August is a ""reversion to the mean.""  Migration numbers across the board ""fell off a cliff"" in late March 2020 after the Trump administration activated Title 42, a provision of the 1944 Public Health and Safety Act that allows Border Patrol to expel any migrant for health and safety reasons, in this case to limit the spread of COVID-19 into the U.S. Since migration numbers bottomed out in April 2020 because of Title 42, the increases in migrant numbers throughout the remainder of 2020 returned monthly totals closer to average levels, Arthur said.But that steady rise changed in February, when U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported the 61% uptick.""We are seeing a reversion to the mean as it relates to unaccompanied children, but we saw a huge spike (in February 2021), and it’s a bigger spike than we’ve seen in any February ever,"" Arthur said. !function(e,i,n,s){var t=""InfogramEmbeds"",d=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(""script"");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,""infogram-async"");That uptick occurred in the same month the Biden administration suspended Title 42 for unaccompanied children only, leaving it in place for all other categories of apprehended migrants, much to the chagrin of immigrant advocates. In late January, after a federal appeals court ruled that the federal government could use Title 42 to expel unaccompanied minors, the White House announced that, unlike under the Trump administration, it would no longer apply Title 42 to children crossing the border alone.The uptick in unaccompanied minors was recorded soon after that announcement. And as of March 23, there were 4,962 children in Customs and Border Patrol custody, well above the 30-day average of 3,243, according to NBC News.""I can’t identify a single other factor that would point to that,"" Arthur said. ""There’s no other variable other than that.""Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 27, 2023 in a Facebook postU.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar is ""facing 40 years in prison and deportation after seven new crimes uncovered.""By Tom Kertscher • February 2, 2023Push vs. pull factors While Arthur highlights the White House’s policy change as a pull factor that was a primary driver behind February’s uptick, other experts underscore the push factors driving migrants out of their origin countries. Migrants and migrant children travel from their origin countries — primarily Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador — to the southern U.S. border for a multitude of reasons: worsened economic conditions due to COVID-19, cartel violence, corruption, natural disasters, agricultural diseases or droughts and, among others, the vagaries of U.S aid. These issues have factored into people’s migration decisions for decades. One such push factor challenged the Central America region in November, when two category-4 hurricanes struck Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala within a two-week span. More than 200 people were killed, and millions were left in need of aid. The hurricanes exacerbated poverty and worsened access to clean water, giving an extra nudge to people considering northern migration. ""There are clearly push factors coming out of all those countries, regardless of what our policies are,"" said Ruth Wasem, a professor of public policy at the University of Texas. And it’s hard to say that pull factors created by liberalized U.S. immigration policies are stronger than the push factors driving migrants away from their origin countries, she said. To Wasem, it’s no surprise border authorities are reporting high numbers of unaccompanied minors after four years of austere immigration policies under the Trump administration, which revamped the asylum-seeking processes in many ways that reduced the number of asylum seekers entering the U.S.  But the near closure of the U.S.-Mexico border under Trump doesn’t mean that migrants stopped packing their bags for the U.S. ""Trump basically shut down our immigration system and ended the laws on the books,"" Wasem said. ""So there’s going to be a pent-up number of people that were waiting to come, or that were en route."" Wasem points to data from the Mexican Commission for Refugee Assistance, a Mexican federal agency that processes refugee-status applications. Under Trump administration policies, asylum seekers were required to apply for asylum and be denied in one of the countries they passed through before seeking asylum in the U.S. According to the data, monthly application numbers ebbed and flowed prior to Biden’s policy changes, showing that push factors in origin countries are a major driver behind migrant and unaccompanied children seeking to enter the U.S., Wasem said. ""Unaccompanied children coming to the U.S. is a result of what's going on in the countries they're coming from,"" she said. ""How we respond to them changes from administration to administration. So when Escobar says the increase in unaccompanied children didn't happen as a result of Biden, I would say the ebb and flow isn't a result of who's in the White House."" That logic is echoed by other immigration researchers. Writing for the Washington Post, Director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Center Tom Wong and University of California at San Diego researchers say that the latest spike is attributable to a migration backlog. ""The current increase in apprehensions fits a predictable pattern of seasonal changes in undocumented immigration combined with a backlog of demand because of 2020’s coronavirus border closure,"" they wrote in their analysis of federal immigration data.  Long-term federal data suggests that ""Title 42 expulsions delayed prospective migrants rather than deterred them — and they’re arriving now,"" they wrote.  The Biden factorThere’s little doubt that migrants, and young children in particular, are being sent across the border inspired by Biden’s new immigration policies. But Wasem says that the hope Biden administration policies have inspired in migrants is hard to measure. ""Are people coming because the thought of Biden’s presidency gives them hope? That might be. But you can't measure that,"" she said. One 9-year-old boy, for instance, traveled on foot for over a month through Mexico from Honduras aiming to connect with a family member in Florida. He was discovered by Border Patrol in the Rio Grande Valley and told one ABC News reporter that his mother had sent him because she had heard that immigration authorities were turning families away, but not children. Biden himself has acknowledged that while his administration has drawn the attention of migrant families, his more humanitarian policies can’t be the only factor compelling families to send their kids on the perilous northward journey. Many of the push factors cited by Wasem — like worsening poverty or gang violence — are also factoring into the calculus of migrants.""That (9-year-old boy’s) mother did not sit around at the kitchen table and say, ‘I got a great idea. The way I’m going to make sure my son gets taken care of is I’m going to send him on a 10,000-mile journey through the desert into the U.S. because I know Joe Biden’s a nice guy and he’ll take care of him,’"" Biden said. ""What a desperate act to have to take. Circumstances must be horrible."" Our rulingEscobar, whose office did not respond to requests for comment, said that increases in the number of unaccompanied minors reaching the southern U.S. border have been increasing since April 2020, when Trump was president.  It’s accurate to say that the number of children traveling alone to the border has been increasing since last April, but her statement downplays the fact that February saw a record increase in unaccompanied minors encountered by Border Patrol agents.Escobar also said that these increases are not ""a result of Joe Biden becoming president."" Experts say that the pull factor created by Biden’s policy change to stop expulsions of the minors is one of several factors driving the uptick in unaccompanied minors. However, there’s dispute over whether this pull factor is a more primary driver than other push factors. We rate this claim Half True.",Veronica Escobar,"March 29, 2021",half-true

So a clean energy future that is based upon those kinds of solutions that are dominated by China is really a pro-China agenda.""While Rodgers singled out China, she also included all of Asia, which would include longtime allies such as Japan and South Korea. With an eye on the geopolitical angle she emphasized at the end, we looked at what the numbers say about American reliance on China for renewable energy materials.China’s current dominance in key materials is real. Whether that means a clean-energy policy amounts to a pro-China agenda is another question.We’ll go through the three renewable power systems Rodgers listed and weigh whether the data support her broader concern.Malaysia supplies the most solar panels, but the building blocks come from China Rodgers is right that most solar panels come from Asia. The solar supply base extends beyond China, but it does have a critical reliance on Chinese materials and companies.Rodgers’ staff pointed to a report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, that said ""the United States is most exposed in the solar sector, followed by energy storage and then wind.""The study detailed China’s key role in producing the parts that go into solar panels.A silicon wafer is the building block of a solar panel. It’s the piece that turns sunshine into electricity, and ""more than 90% of the world’s capacity is in China,"" the February report said.The wafers are used to make solar cells and clusters of cells are assembled into solar panels, sometimes called photovoltaic modules. And here’s where the solar supply chain takes a geographic hop.In 2019, the latest year for which the U.S. Energy Information Administration has data, China — even grouped with Singapore by the EIA —  accounted for less than 6% of the solar panels imported to the U.S., as measured by their generation capacity. Malaysia was the single largest supplier, representing about 38% of all shipments. Vietnam came in second with 25%. Does that mean the U.S. relies more on Malaysia than China? Not really. Many of the Malaysian-based solar factories are Chinese-owned. And wafers, which primarily come from China, remain a key component. (Solar companies based in Japan, the U.S., South Korea and Singapore also own plants in Malaysia.)David Sandalow, a veteran of the Clinton and Obama administrations now at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, says such concentration in the supply chain is not a good thing, and it will be important to see production spread more evenly around the globe.But he noted that the dependence is mutual: Chinese companies need American buyers.""If Chinese manufacturers stopped selling to the U.S., other manufacturers would enter the market,"" Sandalow said. Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on January 17, 2023 in an Instagram postGreta Thunberg staged an arrest in Germany.By Ciara O'Rourke • January 19, 2023The authors of the CSIS report caution, though, that ""wafer factories are expensive and technically challenging to build.""China isn’t a top supplier of wind power equipment to the U.S. Rodgers’ claim that 80% of the wind machines are from China or Asia is not right.Three large components go into wind turbines — towers, blades and generators, the units that actually convert the motion of the spinning blades into electricity. The import patterns look a little different for each.The U.S. Energy Department’s latest report shows China providing a fifth of all the imported blades. But for towers, China doesn’t rank in the top five among countries selling to the U.S. And for wind-powered generating systems, China accounts for about 5% of imports.In dollar terms, China represents only 16% of imports to the U.S. for all wind power parts, nowhere near the 80% Rodgers claimed. However, wind turbines rely on powerful magnets, and those magnets need compounds that tend to come from China. China dominates supply of rare earth minerals, but U.S. is stocking upRodgers specifically highlighted rare earth minerals and their tie to renewables. The connection is strongest for wind power and electric vehicles. The magnets in wind turbines and electric car motors require neodymium and dysprosium, two of the 17 rare earth minerals.She also mentioned batteries, which are essential to storing power from wind and solar, and for running electric cars and trucks. Batteries rely on cobalt and lithium, which are not on the list of rare earth elements. The Democratic Republic of the Congo dominates the cobalt supply. Australia and Chile produce most of the world’s lithium.China dominates the production of rare earth minerals on a commercial scale. Between 2016 and 2019, China supplied 80% of the U.S. demand for these materials. China also accounts for about 80% of global production. The main caveat is that supply chains aren’t locked in for all time. While these minerals are called ""rare earth,"" they are not rare. Neodymium, for example, is about as common as zinc or lead. The problem is they generally aren’t concentrated enough to make commercial extraction worthwhile. In testimony March 22 before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, former Obama administration Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said ""there’s no doubt, as a sane energy security issue, we need to work to diversify these sources of minerals and their processing."" That effort is underway. In 2019, the Trump administration triggered the Defense Production Act, and the Pentagon signed contracts with domestic suppliers. The U.S. government now has a stockpile of 600 tons of neodymium. Building more robust supply chains even rated an executive order from President Joe Biden.With an eye toward finding chemical substitutes, the government’s Advanced Research Projects Agency is backing research to make magnets that are rare-earth-free. However this pans out, part of current clean-energy policy focuses on weaning the U.S. off its dependence on China.Our rulingRodgers said that the Democratic clean energy plan is pro-China, because ""90% of the solar panels, 80% of the wind machines, 90% of the rare earth minerals … are in Asia or in China.""China produces over 90% of silicon wafers, a key building block in solar panels. China produces 80% of the rare earth minerals used in the U.S. for magnets used in electrical vehicles and wind turbines, though its role in wind power overall is far less dominant.But Rodgers' conclusion that the Democrats’ legislation amounts to a pro-China agenda omits key context about the overall direction of U.S. government policy.

249,Julie Appleby,"“Sorry Dr Fauci and other fearmongers, new study shows vaccines and naturally acquired immunity DO effectively neutralize COVID variants.”","That Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky often disagrees with infectious-disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci is well known.Recently, the pair clashed at a Senate hearing when Paul, a Republican, argued against mask recommendations for people who have had Covid-19 or have been vaccinated against it.At the hearing, Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, pushed back against Paul’s characterization of wearing masks as ""theater."" Continued caution is advised, Fauci said, as scientists study the new variants now circulating in the U.S. and other countries.Paul, an eye doctor by training, continued the squabble a few days later, calling out Fauci in a tweet, pointing to a study that he said ""shows vaccines and naturally acquired immunity DO effectively neutralize COVID variants.""The tweet linked to a study published online at the JAMA Network, a family of specialty medical journals.We reached out to Paul’s office for additional sources for his tweet but did not receive a reply.So, we asked the experts: Are Covid variants effectively neutralized by vaccines or natural immunity conferred on people who recover from the illness?In short, the research cited by Paul does show good blood levels of neutralizing antibodies against at least some of the current variants following infection or vaccination. But they’re not the whole story.Mehul S. Suthar, an author of the study Paul cited, said the results are encouraging but should not be seen as all-encompassing: ""Our interpretation is that our study looks at one aspect of immune response, antibodies.""Small samples. Big questions.Neutralizing antibodies are important because they can block the ability of a virus like the one that causes Covid to infect cells. But the body also has other defenses. T cells, for example, can be spurred by infection or vaccination, Suthar said, although the study was not designed to look at those.For the study, researchers gathered blood samples from 40 people who were in the hospital with Covid or had recovered from it. From the National Institutes of Health, they also received blood samples drawn from 14 people who had gotten both doses of the Moderna vaccine, said Suthar, an assistant professor at Emory University’s vaccine center.Then they ran tests on those samples against the original SARS-CoV-2 virus and three variants, including the one dubbed B.1.1.7, which first appeared in the United Kingdom and is now circulating widely in the U.S.They wanted to know: Did antibodies produced by being infected or vaccinated neutralize B.1.1.7?""We are lucky with B.1.1.7 that our antibodies appear to work well against this virus,"" Suthar said.However, as with any study, there are caveats. For one thing, the results were based on a small number of samples. And the analysis did not include other variants of concern, such as the ones that emerged in South Africa and Brazil, which limits the ability to draw broad conclusions.Finally, antibodies are just one measure of potential protection against disease. Laboratory research measuring antibodies indicates that some immunity is created by both illness and vaccination, but the strength and longevity of that protection — the effectiveness in the real world — is a separate question. That’s partly because the ideal level of neutralizing antibodies needed for protection is not known and other immune protections, such as T cells, aren’t measured.Also, in the real world, other factors — such as the variant a person is exposed to, and the presence of  other mitigating factors, including masks and good ventilation — can make a difference.""Part of the reason that real world data are so important is looking at the whole picture of immunity,"" said Gigi Gronvall, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""Also, with the level of community transmissions of disease, I would be concerned that there will be more variants that emerge.""Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on January 17, 2023 in an Instagram postCNN reported that Damar Hamlin’s doctor confirmed his cardiac arrest was caused by a COVID-19 vaccine booster.By Ciara O'Rourke • January 19, 2023Nuance mattersPaul’s tweet — taking aim at what he sees as an overcautious approach by public health experts — doesn’t capture that type of nuance, nor does it reference studies on the other emerging variants.""Blanket assertions made by non-scientific experts are not going to help,"" said Gronvall.Dr. Jesse Goodman, professor of medicine and a specialist in infectious diseases at Georgetown University, agreed.""It’s wrong to declare victory and say there’s no problem with variants and that everyone previously infected will be fine,"" said Goodman, who served as chief scientist of the Food and Drug Administration under the Obama administration.Viruses naturally mutate as they replicate. So it’s not surprising that the coronavirus has done so. Several variants have emerged, including home-grown ones from California and New York.Lab tests on blood samples from vaccine trial participants in South Africa showed lower levels of neutralizing antibody production, possibly related to the variant circulating there.How big a difference the lower levels measured in those samples make isn’t yet known.Levels are still high and could ""effectively neutralize the virus,"" Fauci wrote in an editorial published Feb. 11 in JAMA.Even so, clinical trials used to test Covid vaccines before they were approved for emergency use showed lower efficacy when tested in areas where the South African variant was circulating.""We expect vaccines and prior infection to offer significant protection against variants that are closely related,"" said Goodman. ""But as they become more genetically different — like the South African one — that protection could go down.""The main goal of the vaccines is to prevent hospitalization and death, and all the vaccines in use in the U.S. appear to substantially reduce the risk of hospitalization and death from Covid, according to research.""Even if the current vaccines may not be perfect, they do appear to prevent more severe outcomes,"" Goodman said.Don’t assume, as Paul’s tweet implies, that recovering from covid or getting vaccinated means zero risk of infection.For one thing, reinfection is rare but can occur.Goodman pointed to a recent study conducted in Denmark showing that a small percentage (0.65%) of people who tested positive for Covid in the spring fell ill again.""People should not presume that even if they had the vaccine or were previously infected that there’s no future risk,"" Goodman said.Even though no vaccine is 100% effective, Gronvall at Hopkins said not to use that as an excuse to avoid inoculation.""The vaccines appear to be great,"" she said. ""Get one when you can.""Our rulingPaul is correct that the JAMA study showed vaccination or previous infection appeared, based on a small sample of people, to help neutralize the virus. However, he left out important details that make his position an oversimplification of a complicated issue.The study considered only one variant — the one that emerged in the U.K. — and did not include an analysis of other types now circulating, or the potential for additional variants that could emerge. Also, the type of antibody studied is just one factor in protecting against disease, and just what those levels of neutralizing antibodies  measured in a laboratory experiment may mean in the real world is not known.So, for those reasons, we rate the senator’s statement Half True.",Rand Paul,"March 26, 2021",half-true

Since he lifted the ban, there were 34 incidents.""","After a Colorado gunman killed 10 people in what was the second mass shooting in a week, Democrats and gun control advocates renewed calls for a nationwide ban on assault weapons, like the federal law that was in effect from 1994 until 2004.Joy Behar, co-host of ABC’s ""The View,"" joined the chorus March 23.""In 2004, George W. Bush lifted the ban on those rifles, and since then, the number of massacres has increased 183%,"" Behar said, after rattling off a list of high-profile mass shootings from recent years where the perpetrators used AR-15 style weapons.""During the ban, there were 12 incidents,"" Behar continued. ""Since he lifted the ban, there were 34 incidents. Anybody, or a right-minded person, can see that that gun has to go.""PolitiFact has fact-checked similar claims assessing the impact of the 1994 assault-weapons ban several times following other mass shootings. We wondered if Behar’s statement was true.The first part of her statement was not. The 1994 ban enacted under former President Bill Clinton expired because of a sunset provision written into the law, not because Bush decided to axe it, as Behar claimed. News reports from the time said he was on board with renewing it.But on the second part, we found that Behar’s numbers aligned with at least one researcher’s findings on mass shootings during and after the ban. And experts who study mass shootings said her broader point — that the number of high-fatality incidents has increased since the ban went away — is largely accurate, although proving cause-and-effect is difficult.The 1994 ban had a sunset provisionThe 1994 law, part of an anticrime package authored by then-Sen. Joe Biden, banned the ""manufacture, transfer and possession"" of certain semiautomatic firearms classified as ""assault weapons"" as well as certain high-capacity ammunition magazines of more than 10 rounds. Clinton signed the law, and Bush was in office when it expired. But Bush didn’t scrap the law. ""It had a sunset provision and would end after 10 years without renewal or reinstatement,"" said Adam Lankford, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Alabama.News accounts from the time indicated that as Congress considered extending the ban beyond 2004, Bush said he would support doing so.""There were attempts by members of Congress to reauthorize it, including Dianne Feinstein, and they all failed,"" said Jaclyn Schildkraut, associate professor of criminal justice at the State University of New York at Oswego. ""But it was not George Bush who lifted it.""Behar’s numbers line up with one studyThere’s no universally accepted definition for mass shootings or ""massacres,"" as Behar described the incidents in question.Asked where Behar got her numbers, an ABC spokesperson pointed to a 2018 report in the Washington Post. The report documented the findings that Louis Klarevas, research professor at Teachers College, Columbia University, outlined in his 2016 book, ""Rampage Nation.""Klarevas examined incidents over three decades — before, during and after the 1994 ban — in which six or more people were shot and killed, not including the perpetrators. His findings shook out this way:The decade before the ban, 1984-94: 19 incidents.The decade during the ban, 1994-04: 12 incidents.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 26, 2023 in a postThe officers who beat Tyre Nichols targeted him because he was “allegedly dating” one of their wives.By Madison Czopek • February 1, 2023The decade after the ban sunset, 2004-14: 34 incidents.That shows a 183% increase from the decade during the ban to the decade after it ended. Klarevas told PolitiFact that Behar’s claim was largely accurate, save for the blame she wrongly heaped on Bush — and one other caveat.The research Behar cited ""does not account for all high-fatality mass shootings since the federal ban expired,"" Klarevas said. It accounts for only the first 10 years after the ban.""Behar actually understated the raw numbers, because she said 34 incidents ‘since’ the ban was ended,"" Lankford said.Klarevas said that since the ban expired, he has counted 62 incidents in which six or more people were shot and killed, including the recent shootings in Atlanta and Boulder, Colo. ""To put this in perspective, during the decade of the federal assault weapons ban, there were 12 high-fatality mass shootings. That comes out to an average of 1.2 incidents per year,"" Klarevas said. ""In the 16.5 years since the expiration of the federal ban, there have been 62 high-fatality mass shootings. That comes out to an average of 3.8 incidents per year.""Between the ban’s expiration and the end of 2019, 32% of high-fatality mass shootings Klarevas recorded involved firearms classified as assault weapons, and 82% involved large-capacity magazines, he said.Other related studiesOther research backs Behar’s broader point that mass shootings have gone up since the ban ended. Not all mass shootings are carried out with the style of weapons that were banned. Schildkraut’s research follows a different definition of mass shootings that counts targeted, public shootings in which ""multiple"" victims are injured or killed within 24 hours. By her definition, which doesn’t count shootings related to gang violence or terroristic activity, there were 13 mass shootings involving an assault weapon during the ban, and 27 in the decade after.""We used a different definition of public mass shootings, but our numbers are similar,"" she said. Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, who defines mass shootings as incidents where four or more victims are publicly killed, told the Washington Post that his numbers show ""there has been an increase in both the incidence and severity of mass public shootings (on a per capita basis) since the latter part of the 2000s.""Other recent research came from Christopher Koper, a George Mason University professor who wrote a 2004 Justice Department study that gave fuel to both sides of the gun control debate. In a 2020 report, Koper said the ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines ""had exemptions and loopholes that limited its short-term effects, but its expiration in 2004 was followed by an increase in the use of these weapons in mass shootings and other crimes.""Research Lankford co-authored found that attackers’ increased use of semi-automatic rifles and assault weapons is part of the reason why the U.S. has had more high-fatality shootings over time. Another reason appears to be ""a change in motives"" that has more recent mass shooters seeking to kill large numbers of people for fame and attention, Lankford said. In previous fact-checks, experts cautioned that it's difficult to directly tie increases in mass shootings to the expiration of the 2004 ban. Klarevas, for his part, argued that the data are strong enough to suggest a causal relationship. A 2019 study that he co-authored, which focused on large-capacity magazines, ""suggested that bans on large-capacity magazines were effective at reducing mass shooting violence,"" he said.Our rulingBehar said, ""In 2004, George W.

He stopped building the wall. He put a halt on deportations and he brought back catch and release,"" he said. He later tweeted those same talking points.""Democrats are trying to shift blame but make no mistake - this is the #BidenBorderCrisis. The facts back it up: illegal border crossings are up 173% from 1 year ago and 28% since January when President Biden stopped the wall & deportations and started catch & release,"" he said.While Hudson’s stats aren’t exactly right, he has a point about illegal border crossing numbers increasing significantly since last year and even since January. As for what’s causing the situation at the border, experts say his description is off.The numbersBorder crossing numbers are available at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s website. When the webpage opens, a chart will appear showing data that combines two types of encounters: those recorded by Border Patrol, and those recorded by the Office of Field Operations.What’s the difference? The field office deals with people who showed up at an official port of entry in an attempt to legally enter and were turned away. Meanwhile, Border Patrol data includes people who attempted to enter the country without going through the legal process.If you combine the two pools of data, the total number of encounters this February is 173% higher than it was last February. This is likely where Hudson’s figure comes from. The agency reported a total of 100,441 encounters in February, up from 36,687 last February.However, to focus on ""illegal border crossings,"" it’s more effective to omit field office encounters and focus on Border Patrol data. If we just look at encounters with Border Patrol, they triple from 30,077 last February to 96,974 this February. That’s an increase of 222%.One thing to note is that the agency tracks crossings — not people, meaning some of the documented crossings could be from the same person. In fact, the agency estimated that between last March and this February 38% of all encounters involved recidivism, or individuals who have been apprehended more than once.As for month-to-month numbers, encounters rose roughly 28% with or without field office data.In summary, Hudson is right in that the rise in illegal crossings was likely 173% — at least. He looked at the wrong numbers but the miss doesn’t undermine his point. Now let’s look at what Hudson claims is the reason for the rise. PolitiFact NC interviewed four experts who each said Hudson inaccurately described Biden’s policies and overlooked the myriad of reasons for the situation at the border, which PolitiFact wrote about earlier this month.The wallDoes the wall have anything to do with the current problem at the border? Experts say no. ""The wall was not a factor at all,"" said David Bier, an immigration expert at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. ""It has no effect on whether people cross the border — only on where they cross.""""No more walls are being built right now. But it does not matter,"" said Tony Payan, director of the Center for the United States and Mexico at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy.""The wall has no practicable effect on crossborder irregular migrant traffic or drug smuggling for that matter,"" Payan said.It’s true that Biden has halted construction of the wall along the southern border. However, it’s wrong to suggest that further construction would have made a difference. As PolitiFact has previously reported, former President Donald Trump replaced roughly 200 miles of existing border fencing over four years but erected only a few miles of new border wall. Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 27, 2023 in a Facebook postU.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar is ""facing 40 years in prison and deportation after seven new crimes uncovered.""By Tom Kertscher • February 2, 2023""It is not as if continued construction of border walls and fences would have hermetically sealed the border tomorrow,"" said Lynn Marcus, director of Arizona University’s Community Immigration Law Placement Clinic.""New segments of the wall take years to build,"" said Nicole Hallett, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School. ""The amount of wall that would have been built between January and now is negligible and would have practically no effect on how many people are crossing the border.""DeportationsNow to the last part of Hudson’s tweet. Did Biden ""stop"" deportations? And is that part of the reason for the rise in border crossings? This is a gross mischaracterization.When Biden took office, his administration ordered a 100-day pause on the deportation of people with final orders of removal. However, that pause didn’t apply to people who posed a threat to national security, who were convicted of a felony, or who were incarcerated at the time of the memo. And a federal judge later blocked Biden’s move.Biden also started allowing some asylum-seekers back into the country. That rule-change is expected to affect 25,000 asylum cases, according to a PolitiFact story from mid-February.In the meantime, federal law allows border officials to turn people away because of the public health emergency. This law is referred to as Title 42. Out of the roughly 96,000 migrants encountered by Border Patrol in February, more than 70,000 were turned away because of this rule.Bottom line: Deportations have not stopped.What about a supposed ""catch and release"" policy? Trump and other conservatives have used this term derogatorily over the years, sometimes referring to any rule that allows an immigrant to walk free. However, this Obama-era rule specifically allows asylum seekers to remain in the U.S. while awaiting court dates. (PolitiFact went over the rule in a recent fact check of the Texas governor.) The Trump administration tried to ban ""catch and release"" in 2018. Biden lifted Trump's edict in early February, with the border patrol agency citing housing limitations as part of the reason why.""Per longstanding practice, when long-term holding solutions aren’t possible, some migrants will be processed for removal, provided a Notice to Appear, and released into the U.S. to await a future immigration hearing,"" an agency spokesman told Yahoo News.Experts dismissed the idea that ""catch and release"" has much to do with the rise in border crossings. ""Biden hasn’t changed catch and release policy in any meaningful way from Jan. 20,"" said Bier, the Cato expert. ""More people are being released only because Mexico is refusing to take more than a certain number back. But he is removing far more and releasing far fewer migrants than Trump in the 2019 wave.""Explaining the situationWhen we asked Hudson for the source of his information, his office cited four news articles about immigrants who said they expected Biden’s administration to grant them entry. Spokesman Greg Steele said Biden’s administration is clearly ""contributing to migrants surging to the border."" Experts told PolitiFact they’re not surprised some migrants cite Biden as a reason for their reason for crossing the border, either because they’re overly optimistic or because they’re misinformed.""No doubt, human smugglers take advantage of people's desperation by promising that, with the change in administrations, the U.S. will now welcome them with open arms,"" Marcus said. ""While such messages may give hope to some who incur substantial debt to undertake the dangerous journey to the U.S. border, they are not the main reason people leave, nor are they based on fact.""The four experts who emailed with PolitiFact NC about the situation said there are multiple reasons for the rise in border crossings. ""The number of migrants are on the rise,"" said Payan, the Rice University expert. ""But, interestingly, they are showing the same pattern — they rise in the spring and summer and fall in the fall and winter.""They have cited warming weather, political instability in immigrants’ home countries, hurricanes that hit Central America last year, and the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. They also said Trump’s attempts to reject people seeking asylum, attempts that were challenged in the courts, created a logjam.The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency mentioned some of these causes in a Feb. 10 press release. A Washington Post analysis found that the rise in migrants at the border follows a seasonal pattern set in fiscal year 2019, with the addition of pent-up demand from people who stayed home in 2020 because of the pandemic.Hallett, the expert at the University of Chicago, pointed out that border crossings still haven’t reached the level they were in spring 2019, when there were 100,000 crossings per month for four months straight. ""That would suggest that something independent of U.S. policy is at least partly responsible for the increase,"" she said.Our rulingHudson said ""Illegal border crossings are up 173% from 1 year ago and 28% since January when President Biden stopped the wall & deportations and started catch & release.""Hudson’s numbers are slightly off, but his point about illegal crossings rising nearly 200% is accurate.

252,Miriam Valverde,The border surge is “challenging” because the immigration system that had been in place for decades “was dismantled in its entirety by the Trump administration.”,"President Joe Biden’s top immigration official defended the federal response to the growing numbers of people arriving at the southern border, and claimed that current efforts are complicated by the Trump administration’s drastic changes.Alejandro Mayorkas, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said the Biden administration has a plan and knows what to do, but it will take time to get things done.""And why does it take time now? Why is it especially challenging and difficult now? Because the entire system under United States law that has been in place throughout administrations of both parties was dismantled in its entirety by the Trump administration,"" Mayorkas told ABC News’ Martha Raddatz on March 21.The Biden administration is ""rebuilding the system"" to address the needs of unaccompanied children making their way to the southern border, he said.How accurate is Mayorkas’ claim that the Trump administration ""dismantled"" the ""entire system""?There’s some truth to his broad claim, but the challenges the Biden administration faces can’t all be blamed on the prior administration, immigration experts said.""The border surge is just the latest symptom of a broken immigration system,"" said Laura Collins, director of the George W. Bush Institute-SMU Economic Growth Initiative.Conditions that push migration haven’t changed, and U.S. hasn’t adaptedExperts said it’s important to take a step back and note the underlying factors that push people out of their countries and why the U.S. — regardless of who’s president — has trouble handling their arrival.Persistent corruption, poverty, lack of opportunity and violence in Central America drive people to leave their families and seek a better life in the United States. Recently, hurricanes in Central America made things worse for many people, ruining their crops and displacing them from their homes. The coronavirus pandemic has also left many people without a job.On the U.S. side of the issue, Congress hasn’t passed meaningful legislation to modernize the legal immigration system or to better prepare the federal government for surges at the border. (The last big immigration law was enacted in 1986, when Ronald Reagan was president.)It’s also worth noting that there are seasonal trends at play — migration tends to increase in the spring.Changes in asylum processDHS directed PolitiFact to a statement Mayorkas issued March 16 about the Trump administration dismantling the asylum system. Many people who make it to the southern border ask for asylum.""We have had to rebuild the entire system, including the policies and procedures required to administer the asylum laws that Congress passed long ago,"" Mayorkas said.Under federal law, immigrants may be granted asylum if they have been persecuted or fear they will be persecuted on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. To apply for asylum, people have to be physically present in the U.S. They can apply even if they arrive without legal permission.A backlog of cases existed before Trump took office and continued to grow during his tenure, despite his attempts to limit the number of people filing cases.The Trump administration revamped the asylum-seeking process in many ways, including by:Denying asylum to people who did not ask for protection in another country first;Entering into agreements with Central American countries so that they’d take asylum seekers who would have otherwise applied for protection in the United States; andLaunching the ""Remain in Mexico"" program that sent asylum seekers to Mexico to wait there for a resolution of their case. Previous administrations allowed people into the United States as their case made its way through the complex immigration system. (It can take years for cases to be resolved.)Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 27, 2023 in a Facebook postU.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar is ""facing 40 years in prison and deportation after seven new crimes uncovered.""By Tom Kertscher • February 2, 2023Trump’s administration also tried to discourage people from coming to the U.S. to apply for asylum by implementing a policy that ultimately separated parents and children upon arrival at the border. The Biden administration got rid of that policy and launched a task force to help reunify families. Biden’s administration has also begun letting in asylum seekers stranded in Mexico.Separately, Trump also weakened another venue for legal migration — the U.S. refugee program. People apply for refugee admission from outside the U.S. (in their home countries or in refugee camps elsewhere). Before leaving office, President Barack Obama said the U.S. should let in as many as 110,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017. When Trump took over, he said that was too much and capped it at 50,000. Trump continued to lower the caps every year he was in office. Biden has pledged to significantly raise the admissions cap.Elimination of Central American Minors programMayorkas’ statement also said that Trump ""tore down"" the Central American Minors program — created in 2014 by the Obama administration to address a surge of children fleeing gang violence and arriving alone at the border. The program sought to deter Central American children from making the dangerous trip north.The program allowed certain parents lawfully present in the United States to petition for their children in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras to come in as refugees.

Mayorkas and Democratic lawmakers argue that its absence contributes to the current surge.But Democrats are overstating the program’s impact, experts said. Plenty of kids were left out of it, due to eligibility requirements and its lengthy application process, said Jessica Bolter, an associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute.The program ""had not yet developed into a fully effective alternative to illegal immigration for a broad population,"" Bolter said.Also, it ended years ago, so ""it doesn’t make sense that the effects would suddenly appear this year,"" she said.Biden’s administration is restarting the program.In this June 18, 2014 photo, boys await medical appointments in a holding area at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Nogales Placement Center in Nogales, Ariz.

But they also emphasized that other factors likely carried more weight in people’s decision to migrate.Obama’s administration in 2014 decided that improving living conditions in Central America would be beneficial to the U.S. and approved a new strategy to increase annual foreign aid to the region. Trump’s administration did the opposite, proposing cuts instead.Annual funding for the Central America strategy declined from $750 million in fiscal year 2017 to $505.9 million in fiscal year 2021, a Congressional Research Service analysis found. And amid an immigration surge in 2019, the Trump administration suspended that support while it negotiated asylum agreements with El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.That pause ""was a colossal waste,"" said Susan Martin, a professor emerita at Georgetown University and director of the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform from 1992 to 1997. None of the three countries are safe or capable of processing asylum applications, she said.Aid targeted toward the problems in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador ""would have been much more effective in reducing emigration pressures over time,"" Martin said.It’s hard to tell at this point how much impact those aid cuts have had on migration.""A lot of foreign assistance is about investing in long-term change rather than short-term results,"" Collins said. ""Lots of foreign assistance won’t fix migration on its own, but it is an important piece of a comprehensive approach.""Biden has pledged to invest $4 billion in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to improve conditions there and lessen the desire to migrate to the U.S.Our rulingMayorkas said the border surge is ""challenging"" because the immigration system that had been in place for decades ""was dismantled in its entirety by the Trump administration.""Trump’s administration did make significant changes to the U.S. immigration system, including the asylum-seeking process for migrants arriving at the southern border.While those actions may have an impact on migration, they are not wholly responsible for a surge in migration or the Biden administration’s ability to deal with it, experts said.Mayorkas’ statement is partly accurate.

254,Kiannah Sepeda-Miller,The American Rescue Plan Act “does not” include “checks and balances” on how funds for state and local governments can be spent.,"After failing to stop the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package from becoming law, Republicans are blasting the plan as a bailout for poorly managed Democratic states and cities.A key piece of the criticism has been the stipulation that $350 billion be siphoned off for state and local governments, money Democrats who pushed through the legislation with no Republican support argue will blunt the pandemic’s fiscal fallout.Rep. Mike Bost, a Republican from Murphysboro in southwestern Illinois, joined the national GOP chorus when in a WJPF radio interview he claimed there was nothing in the legislation limiting how states can spend the money.""Where are the checks and balances in the issuing of these funds? Where is it that in there it says, it can only be used for A, B, C and D? It does not,"" Bost said. ""And that’s the problem.""The law — dubbed the ""American Rescue Plan"" by President Joe Biden — is more flexible than previous aid packages in how money can be spent, experts told us. But it’s also not a free-for-all.More leeway, but some limitsA relief bill passed last year, when Republicans controlled the White House and the U.S. Congress, earmarked $150 billion in state and local government aid for expenses tied only to the public health emergency. After last year’s law — dubbed the CARES Act — took effect, guidance from the federal Department of the Treasury explained funds could go beyond direct health care spending to cover items such as payroll for first responders and costs associated with caring for the homeless community.The text of the latest aid package sets more flexible guidelines, allowing state and local governments to spend on the pandemic’s ""negative economic impacts."" According to the language of the new law, funds can go toward increased pay for essential workers, preventing cuts to government services, and making investments in water, sewer, or broadband infrastructure as well. And unlike the 2020 CARES Act, it covers costs incurred through 2024.Bost spokesperson Alex Naughton, responding to our inquiry in an email, said the Democrats’ package lacks ""any meaningful guardrails"" for how state and local governments can spend the funds.""They so loosely defined the terms of what’s an acceptable use of funds … that literally almost any expense could qualify,"" Naughton said. ""This effectively creates a slush fund to use on whatever they want, as long as they paste a ‘pandemic response’ label on the package first.""Experts agreed the new law provides considerable leeway, but they added that it does set some limits and outlines penalties for states and municipalities if they go beyond the legislation’s parameters.Featured Fact-checkMarjorie Taylor Greenestated on February 1, 2023 in a House committee hearingIllinois “received $5.1 billion at an elementary school there that used it for equity and diversity.”By Jeff Cercone • February 3, 2023Specifically, state and local governments can’t use funds to make pension payments or offset lost revenue from state and local tax cuts enacted since March 3, 2021.In Illinois, the pension fund prohibition is particularly relevant given the state’s struggle to meet its pension obligations. Last April, Democratic state Senate President Don Harmon attracted national media coverage when he sent a letter to Illinois’ congressional delegation requesting $10 billion to help shore up the underfunded pension funds.The prohibition on direct pension spending doesn’t rule out the possibility the federal aid could free up other state money to shift toward pensions. Audit provisions in the law, however, spell out how states would have to return the money if they violate the spending restrictions.""If something is found to be outside the scope of the program, the [state or local] government's on the hook to pay that back,"" said Amanda Kass, associate director of the Government Finance Research Center at the University of Illinois-Chicago’s College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs.Our rulingBost said the American Rescue Plan ""does not"" include ""checks and balances"" on how state and local government funds can be spent.Experts agreed the package is more permissive than previous state and local relief.

255,Laura Schulte,“We have reached our goal to clear the backlog of (unemployment) claims.”,"Over the past year, since the coronavirus pandemic began, Wisconsin’s unemployment system has faced a host of issues. Flooded with applications as stores, restaurants and other businesses shut down or closed entirely, the state Department of Workforce Development struggled to keep up with claims. The situation was complicated by an outdated computer system, one that had to be reprogrammed to accommodate unique elements of the pandemic response, such as bonus payments from the federal government.Employees were transferred from other departments to help with the influx of claims, and new employees were hired to answer the phones and adjudicate cases. Still, by mid-summer more than 100,000 claims were waiting for adjudication, leaving thousands of Wisconsinites struggling to buy food and pay rent. (In many cases, one person had multiple weekly claims awaiting review and approval).In September, Gov. Tony Evers asked the head of the department to resign. The new head, Amy Pechacek, launched a partnership with Google and on Dec. 30, 2020 -- in her first news release as secretary-designee of the department -- declared:""Since the start of the pandemic, our top priority at DWD has been ensuring that all eligible unemployment claims in Wisconsin are paid as quickly as possible. Today, I am proud to say we have reached our goal to clear the backlog of claims.""Now, typically we don’t examine claims that are more than two months old. And we won’t blame a backlog for our tardiness. Rather, we’ll note that this is a good point -- one year since the pandemic began -- to examine where the backlog issue stands.Of course, we’ll examine things as they stood when the claim was made.That said, many things remain the same as they did at the close of 2020 when the backlog was declared eliminated.So, was Pechacek right? Backlog of claims older than 21 days cleared, but not appealsWhen asked about the clearing of the backlog, department spokesperson Amy Barrilleaux told PolitiFact Wisconsin that it was absolutely cleared by Dec. 30, 2020. All claims 21 days or older, she said, had been assigned to an adjudicator at that point, which in the eyes of the U.S. Department of Labor means the claim has been processed. But even though all the claims had been assigned to adjudicators, unemployed Wisconsinites still had to wait for their claims to be resolved, which can take days or weeks, depending on the complexity of the claim -- a point Barrilleaux acknowledged. Featured Fact-checkJoe Bidenstated on January 12, 2023 in remarks at the White House“Take-home pay for workers is going up.”By Louis Jacobson • January 13, 2023At the time the department announced the end of the backlog, there were 9,000 claims assigned for adjudication, going to about 500 adjudicators, according to a Dec. 30, 2020 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report. Asked if any outstanding claims from 2020 are still in adjudication, Barrilleaux would not say, but she noted no claims from 2020 are awaiting assignment to an adjudicator. At this stage in 2021, there are roughly 2,100 claims awaiting adjudication, and on average claims are being assigned to an adjudicator after 7.4 days, far less than the 21 days considered standard for non-pandemic years. So, while the state touted the backlog was eliminated, it didn’t mean everyone had their case resolved.Similarly, a backlog of appeals was not cleared up.When an unemployment claim is denied, the applicant can seek an appeal hearing, in which the claimant and former employer go before an administrative law judge. According to another Dec. 30, 2020 report from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Pechacek acknowledged the backlog, and said the department was working to hire more administrative law judges to manage the load of appeals. At that time, Pechacek estimated about 15,000 appeals were awaiting assignment to a judge, a number she said was too high. But since then, the number of appeals awaiting assignment has continued to grow, not shrink. As of Feb. 20, 2021, more than 16,117 appeals were still pending, according to the department website. Barrilleaux said that the backlog of appeals is mostly caused by a lack of judges and the historic volume of appeals. About 50,000 people filed an appeal in 2020, and 30,972 of those cases had moved through the appeals process as of January, Barrilleaux said. The department is currently hearing appeals from September.  Our rulingAt the end of December, Pechacek said the state had eliminated its backlog of unemployment claims.That was accurate, at least by the measure used by the Department of Labor. But on a practical level, that didn’t mean that the cases had all been resolved. To the contrary, many cases had simply been assigned to an adjudicator at that point, and were awaiting a final decision. And a high volume of appeals meant a delay at that stage as well.Our definition of Half True is ""The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.""That fits here. window.gciAnalyticsUAID = 'PMJS-TEALIUM-COBRAND';window.gciAnalyticsLoadEvents = false;window.gciAnalytics.view({    'event-type': 'pageview',    'content-type': 'interactives',    'content-ssts-section': 'news',    'content-ssts-subsection': 'news:politics',    'content-ssts-topic': 'news:politics:politifactwisconsin',    'content-ssts-subtopic': ' news:politics:politifactwisconsin'});",Amy Pechacek,"March 17, 2021",half-true

Tony Evers 2021-22 budget is a series of proposed changes related to the juvenile justice system.Among them: Evers would raise the age for automatically charging someone as an adult from 17 to 18 — an idea Republican lawmakers rejected two years ago. In a Feb. 16, 2021 news release, state Rep. LaKeshia Myers, D-Milwaukee, commended Evers on the moves.""By restructuring the Department of Corrections Division of Juvenile Corrections (DJC) to include older teenagers, we will end the practice of criminalizing young offenders and waiving them into adult prisons,"" Myers said. ""Wisconsin is one of only nine states in the nation in which 17 year-olds are automatically treated as adults in the criminal justice system.""Is Myers correct? Not exactly.A look at the evidenceWhen asked to provide backup for the statement, Myers’ office directed us to several articles, including a Nov. 1, 2014 Wisconsin Bar Association piece titled ""Adults Only: Returning 17 year olds to Juvenile Court"" and an Oct. 19, 2015 Appleton Post Crescent article ""Lawmakers: Keep 17-year-olds from adult court."" That article noted that a review showed ""Wisconsin is one of just nine states nationwide that prosecutes all 17-year-olds charged with a crime or municipal ordinance violation as adults. In two states, New York and North Carolina, adult court begins even earlier: at age 16."" The same fact was cited in a June 11,  2018 blog entry on the website for the law firm Gimbel, Reilly, Guerin and Brown LLP. Alas, what was true in 2014, 2015 and 2018 is no longer true in 2021, due to legislative activity on the issue in recent years. Getting up-to-dateIn a July 1, 2020 report, the National Conference of State Legislatures said that in 47 states, the maximum age of juvenile court jurisdiction is age 17. That is, those who are age 17, are not automatically tried as an adult.""Three states -- Georgia, Texas and Wisconsin -- now draw the juvenile/adult line at age 16,"" the NCSL report states. That is, those who are 16 are not automatically tried as an adult, but those who have turned 17 are. Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on February 26, 2023 in a postThe officers who beat Tyre Nichols targeted him because he was “allegedly dating” one of their wives.By Madison Czopek • February 1, 2023An official with NCSL said in the past seven years states have passed legislation that modified the ages of youth who fall under the jurisdiction of juvenile courts and they have also modified waiver laws, which apply to cases where a younger person may be  tried in adult court in certain cases after a hearing by a judge.""You can look at it like age of jurisdiction laws are the ‘rule’ and transfer laws are the ‘exceptions to the rule,’"" Anne Teigen, program director of the NCSL’s  juvenile justice program, said in an email. ""States have enacted legislation that have changed both.""All states have transfer laws that allow or require young offenders to be prosecuted as adults for specific serious offenses, regardless of their age.Teigen noted that since many of the ""Raise the Age"" laws were passed recently — including in New York, North Carolina, Missouri and Michigan — not all have been fully implemented.The bottom line here, though, is that Wisconsin is currently one of three, not one of nine. So, in that respect, Myers’ general point -- that Wisconsin is an outlier -- is even more on target, but she is using outdated information to make her point.Our rulingMyers said ""Wisconsin is one of only nine states in the nation in which 17 year-olds are automatically treated as adults in the criminal justice system.""That was true at one time, but the current number is three.

258,Miriam Valverde,Says the Biden administration is canceling immigration detainers and “requiring our law enforcement leaders to release” serious criminal offenders.,"Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration, arguing that interim guidance on immigration enforcement prevents the arrest and deportation of criminals illegally in the country. Moody appeared on Fox News to talk about her lawsuit and said the Biden administration is requiring law enforcement authorities to release criminals.""And now they've released guidance which is basically releasing into our streets serious criminal offenders,"" Moody said on Fox & Friends March 9. ""They are canceling detainers and requiring our law enforcement leaders to release them back into our states. And this includes heroin traffickers, people that are breaking into homes, use of a firearm with some of these felonies.""We took a closer look at Moody’s comment about detainers, which are a tool used by immigration authorities to take custody of people who are slated to be released from local or state law enforcement agencies. Moody’s office provided evidence that Immigration and Customs Enforcement did lift detainer requests for certain inmates in Florida, based on new enforcement priorities.But Moody’s claim about the effect of these moves needs more context. Lifting the detainers doesn’t mean ICE forced law enforcement agencies to release people. Law enforcement agencies are forced to release people because their sentences are complete. And law enforcement agencies aren’t required to comply with detainer requests.In addition, ICE told PolitiFact it is still issuing detainers. But the agency said its priority is removing the most serious offenders, such as gang members, murderers and terrorists.What’s an immigration detainer?An immigration detainer is a notice that the Department of Homeland Security sends to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies informing them of ICE’s intent to assume custody of a person who is being released from law enforcement custody. ICE can lodge a detainer against someone who has served a criminal sentence or someone arrested on local criminal charges.The detainer asks a law enforcement agency to notify ICE about a person’s release date and to hold that person for up to 48 hours (excluding holidays and weekends) to give ICE time to take that person into custody and place them in deportation proceedings. If the 48 hours lapse, the law enforcement agency generally no longer has authority to hold that person.An immigration detainer is not an arrest warrant, and law enforcement agencies are not legally required to comply with the requests.Biden’s immigration enforcement prioritiesOn President Joe Biden’s first day in office, the acting secretary of homeland security ordered a review of immigration enforcement practices and said that in the interim, the department would prioritize the deportation of people presumed to be a threat to national security, border security and public safety. ICE’s acting director in February issued interim guidance reiterating that arrest and deportation priorities include people who were engaged in or suspected of engaging in terrorism; people who had been convicted of an aggravated felony (such as murder) and who were believed to currently pose a threat; and those who unlawfully entered the country on or after Nov. 1, 2020. Under the Trump administration, everyone in the country illegally was a removal priority.Featured Fact-checkFacebook postsstated on January 27, 2023 in a Facebook postU.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar is ""facing 40 years in prison and deportation after seven new crimes uncovered.""By Tom Kertscher • February 2, 2023The new guidance applied to decisions on whether to issue a detainer or whether to take custody of someone for whom a detainer was previously issued. Immigration authorities are not prohibited from arresting, detaining or removing people not on the priority list. Those actions, though, are ""subject to advance review,"" the guidance said.Moody’s evidenceMoody’s office directed PolitiFact to exhibits accompanying the lawsuit, which include an affidavit from an employee of the Florida Department of Corrections, email exchanges between the state employee and ICE deportation officers, and information on inmates in Florida corrections facilities.One of the email exchanges shows the state employee asking an ICE deportation officer ""if ICE has interest in placing a detainer"" on a certain inmate. The officer replied that ""per new administration guidelines, ICE will not take any action"" regarding that inmate, whose criminal record included offenses of burglary (of an unoccupied building, unarmed), larceny, property damage and cocaine possession.ICE also told the state it would not place a detainer on a person who had been found guilty of possession of a firearm or ammunition by a convicted felon and possession of more than 20 grams of cannabis.The emails show ICE was lifting detainer requests on other inmates. ""Subject currently does not meet our removal criteria due to Executive Order, ICE has no more interest in this subject,"" one email said. That inmate had been charged with possession of ammunition by a convicted felon and also had arrest warrants for the sale of heroin.So Moody is correct about ICE ""canceling"" some detainer requests for Florida inmates.ICE also has dropped at least 26 detainer requests in Texas, the AP reported Feb. 13. Most of the 26 people were convicted of drug charges or drunken-driving offenses, but some still fell under enforcement priorities, according to the AP.Two were convicted of sexually assaulting a teenager and another was convicted of indecency with a child, AP said. In the end, two were transferred to immigration custody, and the third had his parole approval rescinded after ICE dropped the detainer and is now set to remain in prison for at least another year, the AP reported.ICE told PolitiFact that data was not readily available on detainers issued or lifted during the Biden administration. ICE has issued approximately 46,000 immigration detainers in fiscal year 2021, an agency spokesperson said. The fiscal year started Oct. 1, 2020, during the Trump administration, which supported the use of detainers.Immigration enforcement priorities are much narrower under the Biden administration than under the Trump administration, so it’s likely fewer detainers are now being issued, said Jessica Bolter, an associate policy analyst at Migration Policy Institute.Our rulingMoody said the Biden administration is canceling immigration detainers and ""requiring our law enforcement leaders to release"" serious criminal offenders.ICE canceled some detainer requests in Florida saying the people in custody no longer met the interim enforcement priorities outlined by the Biden administration. An AP news report said that in Texas, ICE canceled detainers on some people convicted of sex offenses and who did fit the administration’s enforcement priorities. But those inmates ended up back in custody.The canceling of an ICE detainer does not by itself trigger a person’s release from local or state custody. The detainers are placed on people who are already scheduled to be released. ICE said it’s still issuing detainers.Moody’s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out some context.

Gavin Newsom claimed during his State of the State Address yesterday that California’s overall mortality rate was one of the lowest during the pandemic. ""California’s death rate has remained one of the lowest per capita in the nation: 134 deaths per 100,000, compared to 158 nationally, 153 in Texas and 247 in New York,"" Newsom said during his speech at Dodger Stadium on March 9, 2021. That characterization, as we’ll explore, appears to be an exaggeration.Daniel Lopez, a spokesman for the governor, said Newsom’s statement about ""one of the lowest"" death rates is accurate ""when you compare California among states with a population greater than 10 million.""Based on this comparison California is only behind North Carolina which has [a] population of approximately 10.5 million,"" Lopez added. That’s correct. But Newsom made a more sweeping statement in his speech and did not offer clarification.A moment earlier, Newsom accurately noted the number of empty stadium seats behind him were about the same as the 54,395 Californians who had lost their lives to the virus over the past year. The number had increased by more than 300 less than a day after Newsom’s speech. The overall total is the most of any state in the nation. That grim ranking is not necessarily surprising as California has a higher population than any other state.For this fact check, however, we wanted to know whether Newsom got it right when he claimed California’s per capita death rate remained ""one of the lowest"" in the country. From Early Success To Middle Of The PackEarly in the pandemic, California was praised for its relatively low mortality rate compared with other populous states. As Vox noted in mid April 2020, New York had ""14 times as many coronavirus deaths as California,"" despite California being among the first states to report COVID-19 cases.Within months, however, as Californians stopped staying home and restrictions eased, a summer surge of coronavirus cases and deaths hit the Golden State. ""Death rates change over time,"" Lee Riley, professor and chair of infectious disease and vaccinology at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health told us in an email. ""So, [assessing how California has fared] really depends on when you look at the data.""Looking at the data now, Newsom got the numbers mostly right. Featured Fact-checkRon DeSantisstated on January 17, 2023 in a press conference""Almost every study now has said with these new boosters, you're more likely to get infected with the bivalent booster.""By Yacob Reyes • January 20, 2023California’s per capita mortality rate was 137 per 100,000 people on the day of Newsom’s speech, according to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention. That ratio is lower than the national average of 158 per 100,000, and better than per capita rates in Texas (153 deaths per 100,000 people) and New York (245 deaths per 100,000 people), as the governor claimed. But to characterize California’s rate as ""one of the lowest"" in the nation is a stretch. The 137 deaths per 100,000 puts it in the middle of the pack, or 23rd lowest out of 50 states, the CDC data shows. In early February, California’s overall ranking was better at 18th lowest, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis.""Being in the middle of the pack in the United States is nothing to boast about,"" added John Swartzberg, an infectious disease expert and professor emeritus at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health. ""The US's performance by almost all metrics (including deaths) is one of the worst in the world.""Currently, some individual counties such as Los Angeles and Imperial continue to have a much higher death rate than the nation’s average. Los Angeles was at 201 deaths per 100,000 this week. The rate is much higher for the county’s Latino population, at 321 deaths per 100,000, according to county data. ""Only 6 states reported higher rates,"" than Los Angeles County’s rate, Riley noted in his email.

Gavin Newsom claimed California’s per capita COVID-19 death rate remained ""one of the lowest"" in the nation, lower than the national average and rates in Texas and New York. CDC data place California’s mortality rate at 137 deaths per 100,000. That’s lower than the national average of 158 deaths per 100,000 and better than rates in Texas and New York. But there are 22 other states with a lower death rate than California, meaning the state is closer to the middle than the low end. A spokesperson for Newsom said the governor’s claim is accurate when looking at states with more than 10 million people, but Newsom made no such clarification in his speech.At one point early in the pandemic, California was praised for having a relatively low death rate.

The congressional record shows that Democrats uniformly panned it. Blunt’s tweet doesn’t say whether Democrats had another plan to help schools. They did.So, what was in the proposal that made so many Democrats say no? Was it pure politics? The answer may lie in the carrot versus the stick.  Withholding money to schools Blunt’s amendment centered on penalties rather than straight aid that Democrats proposed. His proposal would have allowed Congress to limit or withhold COVID-19-related emergency relief to K-12 schools that did not reopen for in-person learning after their teachers received vaccinations.Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the assistant majority leader, said Democrats voted against it because they objected to a punitive approach.Featured Fact-checkMarjorie Taylor Greenestated on February 1, 2023 in a House committee hearingIllinois “received $5.1 billion at an elementary school there that used it for equity and diversity.”By Jeff Cercone • February 3, 2023""This amendment would’ve prohibited schools from getting critical resources to implement public health protocols,"" Murray’s office said in a statement to PolitiFact Missouri.""And as a result, this amendment would’ve made it that much harder for schools to re-open for in-person instruction.

261,Jon Greenberg,"In rejecting his amendment, “Democrats voted to send reopening money to schools that refuse to reopen.”","The path toward bringing students back to real classrooms with teachers and desks and art in the hallways has taken many twists and turns. The Democrats’ massive COVID-19 relief bill has $125 billion to help schools bring their students back and make up for a troubled year.Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., had an amendment that would tie aid to how fully reopened a school was. When his amendment failed on a mostly party-line vote, Rubio tweeted his disdain.""Tonight, Democrats voted to send reopening money to schools that refuse to reopen,"" he wrote March 6.Tonight Democrats voted to send re-opening money to schools that refuse to re-open. https://t.co/aQgVBDTUzh— Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) March 6, 2021 Let’s unpack that.Rubio’s proposalThe relief package provided money for a variety of purposes, including summer remedial education, student counseling, rebuilding ventilation systems and taking any steps needed to slow the spread of the virus.Rubio’s amendment would have tweaked the distribution formula for those billions in school aid. Under his proposal, every school district could count on getting 25% of whatever amount would be its share. (That share would be tied to the federal Title I funds the district normally received.)Beyond that 25%, ""for each school day in a five-day school week"" that district schools were open to 100% of their students, the district would get an additional 15% of its money. ""This amendment incentivizes us to get our kids back in school,"" Rubio said March 6 on the Senate floor. And he targeted one group that he felt stands in the way. ""We do have unions — and to be fair, not all — but we do have unions that say, ‘We're not going back until next year,’ even if all the (safety) measures are put in place,"" Rubio said.The limits to Rubio’s complaintRubio chastised Democrats for voting to send reopening money to schools that refuse to open. But his criticism contains some misleading elements.Rubio’s term ""refuse to reopen"" casts schools as adopting a policy simply as a matter of preference. But many factors drive school closures. Education researchers who have pulled together data on schools and the coronavirus found that schools that choose to reopen don’t necessarily stay open.The Center for Reinventing Public Education at the University of Washington has been tracking 477 school districts. Many of them began to bring students back at the start of the school year, but then reversed course. Between November and December, remote learning increased, by 7% in suburban communities and 20% in urban areas.Featured Fact-checkLauren Boebertstated on February 7, 2023 in a tweetJoe Biden closed schools during the COVID-19 pandemic.By Amy Sherman • February 8, 2023""Several districts shifted toward more opening through the fall but seemed to pull back on these partial reopenings as the winter surge took hold,"" said center associate director Betheny Gross.  Tactical shifts in response to the virus make it difficult to define schools as ones that ""refuse to reopen."" Gross said the great majority of schools seem to aim to reopen at least partially. Only about 7% relied solely on remote teaching for all grades in October, November and December.Rubio’s claim also simplifies the nature of the bill’s school aid. The $125 billion is aimed at much more than just reopening schools. With an eye on remedial teaching, it orders districts to reserve 20% of their funds for measures such as summer school, after-school tutoring and an extended school year. The school aid spans many years to sustain efforts to help students make up lost ground.We reached out to Rubio’s office and did not hear back.The Democratic school reopening policyRubio’s comment suggests that returning kids to school is a low priority among Democrats.In January, President Joe Biden released a pandemic strategy plan that said the country is ""committed to ensuring that students and educators are able to resume safe, in-person learning as quickly as possible, with the goal of getting a majority of K-8 schools safely open in 100 days."" The following month, a reporter asked press secretary Jen Psaki to elaborate on Biden’s goal of reopening schools. ""His goal that he set is to have the majority of schools — so, more than 50% — open by day 100 of his presidency,"" she said Feb. 9. ""And that means some teaching in classrooms. So, at least one day a week. Hopefully, it’s more. And obviously it is as much as is safe in each school and local district."" A week later, at a CNN town hall, Biden said ""the goal will be five days a week,"" and he thought that for grades K-8, the country would ""be close"" to seeing a majority of schools fully reopened. High schools, with the greater chances of viral spread, might be more challenging, Biden said.Our rulingRubio said that ""Democrats voted to send reopening money to schools that refuse to reopen.""Democrats voted down a Rubio amendment that would have tied the school aid amounts to whether school buildings were open to students.But education experts said it is not accurate to define closed or partly closed school buildings as ones that ""refuse to reopen."" Some schools that brought some students back backtracked in response to surging infections in the community. Also, Rubio described the Democratic vote as being narrowly about reopening. They voted for money to help more schools reopen, to make changes to stay open and to provide remedial instruction to make up for lost ground.Rubio’s claim is partly accurate, but leaves out important context.

262,Jill Terreri,"Says Gov. Andrew Cuomo ""issued a legal blanket immunity, and snuck that into our budget, giving these facilities essentially a license to kill, a get-out-of-jail free card.”","Assemblymember Ron Kim has been concerned about nursing home residents during the COVID-19 pandemic, and his policy disagreements with Gov. Andrew Cuomo garnered national attention after he said Cuomo bullied him during a phone call.New York approved broad legal protections for health care facilities during the pandemic as part of the 2020-21 state budget. The protections, retroactive to March 7, were meant to relieve some of the burden on the health care system amid an emergency. They were narrowed in August.But legislators have said the protections were not widely known when the New York State Legislature passed the budget in April. Kim, who voted against the budget for other reasons, said that he found out about them from a reporter months later.In an interview with Brian Lehrer on WNYC, the Queens Democrat said that Cuomo ""issued a legal blanket immunity, and snuck that into our budget, giving these facilities essentially a license to kill, a get-out-of-jail free card."" These legal protections are a source of concern for people whose loved ones died in nursing homes, and we wondered about the breadth of the legal immunity granted to nursing homes. ‘Blanket immunity’Kim said the provision grants health care facilities ""legal blanket immunity."" The protections are broad, but even nursing home advocates say they don’t provide blanket immunity. The original provision limited liability for health care workers, administrators, board members, and health facilities, including hospitals and nursing homes, as long as a state of emergency remains in effect. It pertained to the care of any patient, whether sick from COVID-19 or not. An amendment to the law in August limited the scope of the law to only coronavirus patients.  Under the law, health workers and health facilities ""shall have immunity from any liability, civil or criminal, for any harm or damages"" related to the delivery of health care. The law does not apply in cases of ""willful or intentional criminal misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or intentional infliction of harm …"" But it also states that ""acts, omissions or decisions"" resulting from shortages of staff or resources should not be considered ""willful or intentional criminal misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or intentional infliction of harm.""  Margaret Somerset, a lawyer with Underberg & Kessler in the Rochester area who represents nursing homes, said that the law only provides qualified immunity from civil and criminal prosecution if the medical provider does not act with gross negligence or recklessness.  She also said that the law specifically states that shortages of PPE or staffing may not be used as evidence of gross negligence or recklessness. The law was also amended in August 2020 to limit its application to providers engaged in either diagnosing or treating Covid-19 patients.  A report from state Attorney General Letitia James said the law should not be interpreted to mean it provides ""blanket immunity,"" but it also raised concerns.""Due to several recent changes in law, it is unclear to what extent facilities or individuals can be held accountable if found to have failed appropriately to protect the residents in their care,"" the report said. It also said James disagrees with any interpretation that the law provides blanket immunity for things other than intentional harm, even when related to intentional resource and staffing allocations, calling it ""illogical, contrary to public policy, and contrary to the law’s intent.""Nina A. Kohn, a distinguished scholar in elder law at Yale University and a law professor at Syracuse University, said Kim’s use of ""blanket immunity"" is how she would expect a layperson to use the term. But legally speaking, it’s not accurate, because the law does not say that you can never be held liable for anything. Nonetheless, Kohn said, the law gives ""a green light for facilities to understaff and underresource. The language seems plain to me."" The exceptions, however, such as gross negligence, can be difficult to prove. James Snyder, a plaintiff’s lawyer in the Syracuse area who has written about the immunity law, said gross negligence exists in New York law, ""but imposes an incredibly high burden of proof upon  anyone attempting to make a claim for personal injury pursuant to it."" Featured Fact-checkViral imagestated on January 17, 2023 in an Instagram postCNN reported that Damar Hamlin’s doctor confirmed his cardiac arrest was caused by a COVID-19 vaccine booster.By Ciara O'Rourke • January 19, 2023‘Snuck it in’Kim said the governor snuck the immunity protections into the budget. Kim’s chief of staff, Tony Cao, told us that when Kim inquired about the provision, once he learned about it after the budget vote, he was told by Assembly leadership that the administration fought forcefully for the provision, telling both houses it was non-negotiable. Kim’s office also provided a letter from the Greater New York Hospital Association, which hailed the passage of the provision. ""GNYHA drafted and aggressively advocated for this legislation,"" President Kenneth Raske wrote to the association’s members. We asked the Cuomo administration about the provision, and aides said that the budget, which is voted on by legislators, is the subject of negotiations between the executive chamber and both houses of the State Legislature. ""It’s an impossibility to ‘sneak’ anything in to the budget — we engage with legislative staff in ongoing negotiations throughout the budget process, those staff must physically sign off on every individual provision before the bill is printed, and every legislator can of course read the language themselves,"" said Beth Garvey, special counsel and senior advisor to Cuomo. The budget bills run hundreds of pages, and lawmakers typically have only hours from the time they are printed until the vote. The Assembly passed the 2020-21 budget in the wee hours of the morning. ‘License to kill’Kim said that nursing homes have ""essentially a license to kill"" and a ""get-out-of-jail free card."" Cao, Kim’s chief of staff, said that isn’t hyperbole. When the order granting immunity is combined with other measures the administration took to ease the burden on health care workers and institutions navigating an unforeseen crisis -- as well as the high bar to prove gross negligence, recklessness or intentional harm in court --– he said families have little recourse if their loved ones were harmed in nursing homes during the pandemic. Cao pointed to an executive order relaxing paperwork requirements, which expired at the end of December. ""Any person acting reasonably and in good faith under this provision shall be afforded absolute immunity from liability for any failure to comply with any recordkeeping requirement,"" it stated. Without paperwork documenting patients’ conditions, and with the pandemic preventing visits by family members, building a case is impossible, Cao said. The Cuomo administration said the expectation and intent of the recordkeeping order was not that facilities would keep no records, but that they did not always have to stringently complete records at all times during the emergency, Garvey said. Many of those records were finalized after the fact, she said. The Cuomo administration’s position is that the intent of the law was to prevent lawsuits unless there was intentional misconduct. If a facility accepted patients it could not care for properly due to staff or resource shortages, that could be intentional misconduct, she said. But the attorney general’s report raises the possibility of a loophole in the law. It states that the law ""is silent as to whether the safe-harbor for ‘resource or staffing shortage’ is to be assessed only based on conditions that arose as a result of the COVID-19 emergency or whether it"" applies to shortages that existed before the emergency declaration. The attorney general’s investigation found that poorly staffed nursing homes had higher death rates. James recommends eliminating the immunity provisions because they ""can provide financial incentives to for-profit nursing home operators to put residents at risk of harm"" by not employing enough caregivers or purchasing enough personal protective equipment.Our rulingKim said that a law protecting health care facilities gave them ""blanket immunity,"" was snuck into the budget by Cuomo, gave health care facilities get out of jail free cards and a license to kill. The law contained broad protections, but doesn’t grant blanket immunity. Experts disagree on how broad the protections are. It will likely take court cases to resolve that question. While Cuomo may have fought aggressively for the law during budget negotiations, saying that he ""snuck it in"" minimizes the legislature’s role. Staff and leaders knew about the provision even if many members didn’t.   Kim’s use of ""essentially"" when describing a ""license to kill"" modifies it somewhat. Even the Attorney General’s Office said it is unclear to what extent facilities or individuals can be held accountable if found to have failed appropriately to protect the residents in their care. But the law contains exceptions for some criminal conduct. Coupled with other actions the Cuomo administration took to aid health workers and prevent virus transmission in nursing homes - relaxing recordkeeping requirements related to patient care and prohibiting visitors - families will have difficulty winning cases against nursing homes.  Kim conveyed the difficulty families have in holding nursing homes accountable, but his statement goes too far because the the immunity protections do not cover everything. He made a compelling statement that has elements of truth. We rate his statement Half True.",Ron Kim,"• March 6,",half-true
263,Madeline Heim,"""Youth usage of marijuana has actually gone down in states that have fully legalized.”","Wisconsin’s Republican lawmakers may have made clear that Gov. Tony Evers’ plan to legalize marijuana in the next state budget will go up in smoke, but state Sen. Melissa Agard, D-Madison, isn’t backing down. Agard has pushed the state for years to legalize the drug for both medicinal and recreational purposes, a proposal that garnered little traction under former Gov. Scott Walker and the Republican-controlled Legislature. Today, though, the dynamic is different. Legalization could generate $166 million in revenue that could help fund rural schools and programs for communities that have been disproportionately affected by past marijuana laws, Evers said when he announced the plan. Wisconsin is one of just 14 states that has not legalized marijuana in some form. Fifteen states have legalized recreational marijuana over the past few years, including neighboring Illinois and Michigan, and Minnesota lawmakers have introduced a bill that would do the same. Public support of the idea is also growing in Wisconsin. A 2019 Marquette University Law School poll found 59% of Wisconsin voters backed legalization for recreational purposes, and 83% backed it for medicinal purposes. Still, Republican leaders of the Legislature’s budget committee wasted little time in shooting down the proposal. Though Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, said he believed it was ""too big"" to be inserted into the state budget, Sen Chris Kapenga, R-Delafield, worried about health effects of the drug on kids who choose to use it. We rated Kapenga's claim linking youth marijuana use and psychological disorders True. But Agard jumped in to make another point: ""Youth usage of marijuana has actually gone down in states that have fully legalized,"" she tweeted back. It’s an important claim, because those opposed to legalization often claim that the move will cause a dramatic uptick in teens smoking pot. But is it correct? Let’s take a look. Study says legalization may cause a decrease, but results aren’t as definitive as Agard assertsAlong with her statement, Agard tweeted a link to an analysis on marijuana laws and teen use of the drug from JAMA Pediatrics, a peer-reviewed journal published by the American Medical Association. The analysis, published July 8, 2019, pooled data from each state’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey from 1993 to 2017 to examine the association between legalization and teen marijuana use. Averaging the survey data from seven states that passed recreational marijuana laws from 2012 to 2017 — Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada and Washington — researchers found an 8% decrease in the likelihood of youth marijuana use and a 9% decrease in the likelihood of frequent marijuana use among youth after such laws were passed.Featured Fact-checkMark Obenshainstated on January 31, 2023 in a floor speech.“You know how many children are dying across Virginia because of fentanyl poisoning? A heck of a lot more than are dying at the hands of guns.”By Warren Fiske • February 7, 2023""We interpreted our results as consistent with the argument that it is more difficult for teens to obtain marijuana as drug dealers are replaced by licensed dispensaries that require proof of age,"" study author D. Mark Anderson, an associate professor of economics at Montana State University, told PolitiFact Wisconsin in an email. In some states, recreational sales did not begin until a few years after legalization, so the researchers repeated their analysis based on those dates and got similar results, Anderson said. A caveat of the analysis is that it uses an average — and when looking at states’ raw data from the survey, results are more mixed. For example, in Colorado, there have been no significant changes in current marijuana use among high school students since 2005, according to its Healthy Kids Colorado Survey data. In 2013, a year after the state legalized the drug, 19.7% of high school students had used marijuana in the past 30 days; in 2019, 20.6% had. Alaska’s state survey also reported no significant changes in current youth marijuana use since the drug was legalized in 2015 and sales began in 2016. And in Oregon, which legalized in 2014, current marjiuana use fell among 8th graders after recreational sales began, but rose among 11th graders, data from the state’s 2017 youth survey found. In the 2019 survey, current marijuana use had risen among 8th graders but fallen among 11th graders.It’s also important to note that the Youth Risk Behavior Survey is just one type of study. Though one set of Washington state data, from the Washington Healthy Youth Survey, found that marijuana use in that state did decrease among the state’s 8th and 10th graders after legalization for recreational purposes in 2012, other studies cited in the JAMA analysis did not reach the same conclusion.For instance, a study using data from the Monitoring the Future survey, which assesses drug and alcohol use among youth across the U.S., found a statistically significant increase in marijuana use among 10th graders in Washington after legalization for recreational use. Some say the Monitoring the Future data has too much year-to-year volatility to encapsulate marijuana policy changes — but it’s clear that more review will be needed to fully understand the effects of recreational marijuana laws on youth use. The full effects of marijuana legalization won’t be seen until a generation after national legalization, which still has not happened yet, Jonathan Caulkins, a public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University and former co-director of RAND’s Drug Policy Research Center, told PolitiFact Illinois about a similar claim from an Illinois state representative. Our rating Agard said youth marijuana use has declined in states that have fully legalized the drug for both medicinal and recreational purposes. The JAMA analysis she cited did bear that out, although it has its caveats — when looking at individual states’ data, some that legalized the drug years ago have not seen any meaningful change in youth use.Meanwhile, at least one study found the reverse — an increase in use.

It includes provisions to require states to enact automatic and same-day voter registration and make it easier to obtain a mail ballot. It also has provisions to increase transparency in campaign financing.Republican lawmakers oppose the bill and have stepped up attacks against it in recent days in interviews and on social media as it moved closer to a vote.Last month, PolitiFact fact-checked several misleading claims about H.R. 1, including statements similar to LaMalfa’s. The congressman was one of seven California GOP House members who voted to object to certifying last November’s electoral votes from Arizona and Pennsylvania. Supporters of former President Donald Trump alleged election fraud and irregularities in the two swing states, despite a lack of evidence and legal challenges that went nowhere.Here’s the specific statement from LaMalfa on H.R. 1 that caught our attention:  ""H.R. 1 would also mandate significant changes in election processes that would overrule election practices that have been tailored to thousands of localities across the country.

The ACLU said it supported goals in the bill to make it easier to vote, including restoring voting rights for felons, stopping the purge of inactive voters, increasing online voter registration and providing for no excuse absentee voting. That initial bill passed the House but never reached a vote in the Senate.When Democrats introduced a new version in January, the ACLU told lawmakers that it had ""significant constitutional concerns.""""We have not officially opposed the bill in the 117th Congress,"" Kathleen Ruane, senior legislative counsel for the ACLU, told PolitiFact. ""Following the Trump administration’s relentless attacks on our democratic system of government, a serious legislative effort to restore and strengthen our republic is needed now more than ever, and we strongly support many of the voting rights provisions in H.R. 1.""But the ACLU said requirements for organizations to disclose certain donors are ""onerous and dangerous.""The ACLU’s 2021 letter largely highlights its objections to the Shield Act and the Disclose Act, two Democratic bills rolled into H.R. 1. While the ACLU said it agrees with the Shield Act’s goal to limit interference of foreign adversaries in elections, the act goes too far. The group objected to a provision that makes campaign finance law violations deportable offenses. It also argued in 2019 that the Shield Act would prohibit foreign governments or foreign parties from creating paid ads. ""If the governments of Germany, Canada, and France wanted to take out a nationwide advertisement during the Super Bowl in 2020 explaining why it is so important for the United States to recommit to the Paris Climate Agreement, the Shield Act would forbid that speech,"" the ACLU wrote.Featured Fact-checkRick Scottstated on February 7, 2023 in an adPresident Joe Biden “cheated on his taxes and got away with it.”By Louis Jacobson • February 10, 2023The Disclose Act requires additional disclosures related to political spending, including further restrictions on foreign money in elections. It demands that organizations that make campaign-related disbursements of more than $10,000 in an election reporting cycle disclose the names of donors who give $10,000 or more. The legislation makes it harder for ""dark money"" groups to avoid disclosures.Super PACs can raise and spend unlimited amounts, as long as they don't directly coordinate with candidates or party committees. Super PACs publicly disclose their receipts and expenditures, though they sometimes get big donations from nonprofits, which don't have to disclose their donors.The ACLU said it supports mandated reporting of spending for public communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate for office, but it said the Disclose Act goes beyond those bounds. The legislation ""could harm political advocacy and expose non-profit donors to harassment and threats of violence should their support for organizations be subject to forced disclosure,"" the ACLU wrote.In 2019, the ACLU also said it objected to at least sections of other legislation incorporated into H.R. 1, calling some of the language too vague or invasive of donor privacy.Reactions to ACLU’s objectionsMcDaniel’s tweet maintains that H.R. 1 ""threatens our freedom of speech"" — and she posits that she is in agreement with the ACLU on this point.The liberal Brennan Center for Justice at NYU disagrees with the ACLU’s conclusions that the bill will interfere with free speech, said Daniel Weiner, the center’s deputy director of election reform. Weiner said the goal isn’t to target everyday Americans making small donations, but rather big corporations and powerful interest groups. ""It’s misleading to characterize transparency measures as a significant restriction on freedom of speech,"" he said. ""The notion that these (powerful) groups will be shrinking violets who might get criticized from spending and it might drive them from the public square is a bit much to take.""In a letter to lawmakers in support of H.R. 1, a few former ACLU officials joined with several constitutional scholars in calling the legislation the ""most significant pro-democracy legislation since the Voting Rights Act of 1965.""""We do not view First Amendment concerns over the precise scope of disclosure requirements affecting large donors to tax-exempt organizations operating on the margins of electoral politics as outweighing the need for expeditious enactment of the clearly desirable aspects of H.R. 1 into law,"" they wrote.The Institute for Free Speech, a conservative group that advocates against campaign finance restrictions, sides with the ACLU in arguing that it would chill free speech.""These advocates of restricting free speech want to have it both ways, by arguing that restricting speech is necessary or beneficial, but also that what they propose does not restrict speech,"" said Bradley A. Smith, chairman of the institute and a professor at Capital University Law School, in an email to PolitiFact.Our rulingMcDaniel tweeted that the ""ACLU opposes HR 1"" on grounds that ""it threatens our freedom of speech.""The ACLU opposed the 2019 version of H.R. 1, saying multiple provisions would limit free speech. When Democrats unveiled the bill again in January, ACLU said it still held many of their earlier concerns and called some sections ""onerous and dangerous."" But the ACLU has stopped short of opposing the bill in 2021. While it is clear that freedom of speech for political donors is among the ACLU’s concerns, the ACLU has not opposed the bill in 2021.The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Rep. Ted Budd said in a speech, which he tweeted.Is Budd right about those percentages?The first part of Budd’s quote is accurate. Expert analysis shows a small percentage of the spending is directed at combating the virus through vaccines, protective equipment or resources for health care providers.But that doesn’t mean the rest of the bill isn’t related to COVID-19. A significant percentage of the bill aims to address the financial fallout caused by the pandemic.Combatting COVIDExperts we spoke with put the bill’s spending into three categories: coronavirus containment, things that are tightly or loosely related to the pandemic, and things that shouldn’t be considered related at all.Let’s look first at spending that directly targets COVID-containment. Depending on how COVID-containment is measured, the cost ranges between $100 billion and $160 billion. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group focused on reducing federal deficits, put COVID-19 ""containment"" efforts at $110 billion, or 6% of the bill. The group put vaccine-related activities in a separate group costing about $17 billion, less than 1% of the entire bill. For his part, President Joe Biden said $160 billion would go towards COVID-19 testing, protective gear, vaccine production and distribution. Even if we take this higher number, that would mean the funds directed to fight COVID account for roughly 8.4% of the $1.9 trillion. That means the first part of Budd’s claim is nearly spot-on.What’s COVID-related?But the second part of his claim is off-base. While a lot of the proposed spending doesn’t directly go toward combating COVID, that doesn’t mean it’s not related to the coronavirus. A significant portion is designed to offer economic relief to businesses and people affected by the pandemic.Featured Fact-checkTweetsstated on January 24, 2023 in a tweetDiamond and Silk pundit died from COVID-19By Paul Specht • February 6, 2023Perhaps the most famous part of the plan, direct stimulus payments to individuals, is estimated to cost more than $420 billion. The plan would also extend unemployment benefits and offer financial aid to help schools reopen. Erica York at the Tax Foundation and Stan Veuger at the American Enterprise Institute both described economic relief efforts as ""COVID-related.""""Whether you think they’re wise or not, they’re clearly a response to the economic crisis,"" Veuger said in a phone interview.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget reported that $246 billion would go toward extending unemployment benefits through August and raising the federal supplement payment — a move that would account for roughly 13% of the budget. The Congressional Budget Office also said the proposed unemployment benefits would cost $246 billion. The unemployment benefits, combined with a $400-a-week supplement to state unemployment insurance payments, would cost a combined $350 billion, PolitiFact reported.The CRFB reported that $130 billion, or 7%, would go toward helping schools reopen safely.We asked Budd whether he believes the extension of unemployment benefits is unrelated to the COVID-19 crisis. Spokesman Curtis Kalin didn’t directly answer the question. He said Budd wants to reopen the country. For aid, he said the federal government could use the $1 trillion that hasn’t been spent yet — a claim we’ve rated Half True.Not COVID-relatedTo be clear, the bill does include proposals that experts don’t necessarily see as pertinent.""The Democratic proposal is going beyond what we’ve seen in past relief measures by significantly expanding existing tax credits and making changes to the international tax system,"" York said. ""For instance, lawmakers are proposing expanding the child tax credit,"" she said. ""Opponents might argue that’s wish list and isn’t a speedy form of relief, but proponents might argue it’s COVID-related because the pandemic and downturn have disproportionately affected lower-income households and so policies are being targeted toward the affected populations.""In total, the CRFB estimates the House Democrats’ relief package includes ""at least $312 billion of policies that have little to do with the current crisis."" The group cited the $110 billion to expand the Child Tax Credit and $50 billion to expand health care access through the Affordable Care Act.The CRFB proposed alternative plans costing $1.3 trillion and $1.1 trillion, respectively. Meanwhile, a group of Republican senators proposed a $600 billion plan. Our rulingBudd said about 9% of Biden’s stimulus plan ""is actually going to COVID, meaning 91% of it is not even COVID-related.""In the first part of his statement, Budd accurately describes the proposed spending on efforts to combat the virus itself. However, he’s wrong to suggest the rest of the bill isn’t related to COVID-19 at all.

267,Louis Jacobson,“I have never sued a nun — any nuns.”,"Critics of Xavier Becerra, President Joe Biden’s pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services, seized on a comment he made while testifying before the Senate Finance Committee.During the confirmation hearing, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., asked Becerra, who previously served as California’s attorney general, about his past work on cases involving abortion.""As attorney general, you spent an inordinate amount of time and effort suing pro-life organizations like Little Sisters of the Poor, or trying to ease restrictions or expand abortion,"" Thune said, adding, ""I think the majority of the American people would not want their secretary of health and human services focused or fixated on expanding abortion when we’ve got all of these public health issues to deal with.""Becerra responded that he understands and respects that Americans have deeply held beliefs on abortion.He continued, ""By the way I have never sued a nun — any nuns. I have taken on the federal government, but I have never sued any affiliation of nuns, and my actions have always been directed at the federal agencies, because they have been trying to do things that are contrary to the law in California.""Becerra’s response drew fire from critics on the right, who pointed to years-long litigation between Becerra, representing the state of California, and the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic order.An official with the conservative Heritage Foundation tweeted, ""Wow: Xavier Becerra falsely claims twice, 'I have never sued any nuns.' The Little Sisters of the Poor would like a word."" The National Review was among those to call out Becerra’s claim. So did Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark.🚨Xavier Becerra is now claiming he didn't sue nuns because he wants to get confirmed. But Becerra did sue nuns. He repeatedly harassed the Little Sisters of the Poor. That's why he should be rejected by the Senate. https://t.co/QOtHvENnLx— Tom Cotton (@TomCottonAR) February 24, 2021 The reality is a bit murkier than either side would like to admit. Becerra didn’t ""sue"" the Little Sisters of the Poor, although as a representative of California, he was a plaintiff in long-running litigation against them.Case related to religious rights under ObamacareThe case in question involved not abortion, as Thune claimed, but rather religious rights as they related to the Affordable Care Act.It was part of a series of lawsuits involving the law’s requirements that employer health plans offer free contraceptive coverage. In particular, the litigation revolved around whether sincerely held religious or moral objections to contraceptives would allow the employer to sidestep that requirement.The Little Sisters of the Poor’s interest in this litigation didn’t come out of left field. During the Obama administration, the Little Sisters had sued to be exempted from the rule, even though it did not fit the strict definition of an exempted religious group under the ACA. The case was eventually consolidated with several related cases and argued at the Supreme Court in the case Zubik v. Burwell in 2016. Several members of the order were present for oral arguments. The court eventually sent several of the consolidated cases back to lower courts for further consideration.Sisters with the Little Sisters of The Poor, including Sister Celestine, left, and Sister Jeanne Veronique, center, rally outside the Supreme Court on March 23, 2016. (AP)When the Trump administration broadened the religious exemptions in 2017, Becerra, as the top legal officer for California, challenged the new rule. Officially, the lawsuit was filed against the federal government, and the complaint did not specifically reference the Little Sisters of the Poor.In a statement to PolitiFact, the California attorney general’s office said that in the lawsuit California vs. Azar, Becerra ""sued the Trump administration to defend the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive coverage mandate,"" citing two Trump-era rules that allowed employers to deny coverage. ""By the Trump administration’s own assessment, these rules would have resulted in up to 130,000 women losing coverage.""Featured Fact-checkPublic Interest Legal Foundationstated on January 18, 2023 in a reportIn California, there were “10 million mail ballots unaccounted for” in the November midterm election.By Jeff Cercone • January 26, 2023As the case was working its way through the courts, the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a conservative legal group, petitioned the court in November 2017 to make the Little Sisters of the Poor a co-defendant in the case alongside the federal government. About a month later, the court allowed the Little Sisters to join the case as a defendant, though it said the group didn’t have an absolute right to be part of it.From this point on, documents related to the case referred to the state of California and several other states as ""plaintiffs,"" HHS Secretary Alex Azar and other federal officials as ""defendants,"" and the Little Sisters of the Poor and a few other allied groups as ""defendant-intervenors.""The front page of one legal filing shows Becerra by name facing off against the Little Sisters of the Poor.The case worked its way through the courts, and a related Pennsylvania case that involved the Little Sisters eventually reached the Supreme Court in 2020. The justices ruled 7-2 that the Trump rule changes were valid and sent the California case back to a lower court for further consideration, where it remains today.The California attorney general’s office emphasized that Becerra only sued the federal government, not the Little Sisters of the Poor. The office argues that the Little Sisters’ involvement was thrust upon them by the court, not something the office sought out. Biden transition spokesperson Andrew Bates took the same position.Merritt E. McAlister, a University of Florida law professor, said Becerra had a reasonable point about not having sued the Little Sisters.Becerra ""brought a suit that would affect their religious rights, in their view, but that suit was brought against the federal government, and the Little Sisters inserted themselves into the case, with the court’s permission, because they were interested in protecting their rights, even though the court said the federal government could more than adequately do that for them,"" she said.But Ryan Colby, associate communications director at the Becket Fund, said this distinction is too cute. ""After the Sisters got into the case and he beat them in lower court, Becerra dragged them all the way to the Supreme Court where he lost 7-2,"" Colby said. ""He's literally still fighting them in court today after that loss.""A final footnoteAs some Twitter users have noted, the Little Sisters of the Poor aren’t technically ""nuns."" They’re ""sisters."" ""Nuns live a cloistered life in a monastery and live a contemplative lifestyle — a life of prayer,"" said Margaret McGuinness, a professor of religion and theology at La Salle University. ""Sisters live and work in the world, although prayer is a very important component in their lives.""That said, McGuiness added that ""in ordinary usage, sisters and nuns are used interchangeably.""Our rulingBecerra said, ""I have never sued a nun — any nuns.""As California attorney general, Becerra did not initiate a lawsuit against the Little Sisters of the Poor.

268,Kiannah Sepeda-Miller,"“For the month of February, Illinois has been the vaccination leader among the 10 most populous states in the country.”","Illinois kicked off February with one of the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the country, fueling frustration among many over the program’s sluggish start.Nearly three weeks later, Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the state was making progress thanks to increased supply from the federal government and the efforts of local health departments:""As a result, for the month of February, Illinois has been the vaccination leader among the 10 most populous states in the country,"" Pritzker said in a prerecorded video address, which aired Feb. 17.Has Illinois come as far on vaccinations this month as the governor claimed? We found Pritzker's statement was supported by one metric measured over a few days, but glossed over an otherwise spotty vaccination record.Different measures, mixed resultsThere are many yardsticks to measure states’ progress getting their residents vaccinated against COVID-19. Illinois performs well on some metrics this month but still ranks low on others.Illinois started off the month 43rd in the nation for total doses administered when adjusted for population, according to Our World in Data, a University of Oxford-based project that has been tracking vaccine statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By the time Pritzker’s address aired, the state had improved to 34th nationally — and sixth place when only the 10 most populous states are considered.The state is also performing better on a different metric: the share of residents that have received at least one dose of the vaccine. By Feb. 17, Illinois had taken a narrow lead over the other nine most populous states, and it has occupied first, second or third place in that group each day since.That measurement goes hand in hand with another, though: the share of people fully vaccinated. There, Illinois ranked last among the 10 largest states — and has continued to rank at or near the bottom nationally each day. Experts say it’s tricky to compare states on this measure, however, due to differences in state policies on how much vaccine to earmark for second doses.Given these mixed results, we reached out to the governor’s office to find out what Pritzker was referencing when he said Illinois was the ""vaccination leader"" this month among large states.Pritzker spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh said that, per capita, Illinois leads the most populous states in vaccinations administered in February — and has done so ""for the vast majority"" of the month.Experts said it is fair to compare states based on the total doses administered and adjusted for population. They were split, however, on whether it makes sense to focus on a few weeks in February.Hemi Tewarson, a senior fellow at the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy, said the February snapshot might be helpful to show recent improvement after a sluggish start because of issues outside state control, such as delays with the federal pharmacy partnership program created to vaccinate those in nursing homes.Featured Fact-checkMarjorie Taylor Greenestated on February 1, 2023 in a House committee hearingIllinois “received $5.1 billion at an elementary school there that used it for equity and diversity.”By Jeff Cercone • February 3, 2023""If they started out slow back in December or early January, it's hard to catch up,"" she said.Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said that while month-to-month data is important for gauging a state’s progress internally, it’s not as useful for making comparisons because it doesn’t provide a full picture of a state’s vaccine rollout.Regardless, by Pritzker’s metric Illinois’ lead among large states on total doses administered per capita in February amounted to just a few days out of the month, based on our analysis of CDC figures catalogued by Our World in Data.To support Pritzker’s claim, Abudayyeh sent us a screenshot of a spreadsheet containing figures she said the governor’s office had taken from the CDC’s COVID-19 vaccination tracker. The spreadsheet compares how many doses were administered from Jan. 31 through Feb. 11 per 100,000 residents in the 10 most populous states.Those numbers could not be directly verified because the CDC’s tracker only makes available a current cumulative total on each day.So to check the governor’s figures we turned to Our World in Data again, which makes previous days’ CDC tallies available for users to download. Those numbers matched the governor’s analysis.Day to day, however, Illinois claimed first place three times out of the first 11 days of the month, hardly the ""vast majority"" of February as Pritzker’s spokeswoman claimed. The state’s lead was narrow, and by the time the governor’s address aired, Illinois had fallen back to second place behind Florida.So Priztker’s claim was accurate as of Feb. 12, the last day of his office’s analysis. It was not accurate when his speech first aired five days later.Our rulingPritzker said that ""for the month of February, Illinois has been the vaccination leader among the 10 most populous states in the country.""There are many different ways to measure how states compare when it comes to vaccinating residents against COVID-19.

Pritzker’s office pointed to one very specific metric: total doses administered per capita during the month of February alone.The key issue with Pritzker’s claim is that Illinois only took the lead on that metric for a handful of days prior to the governor’s prerecorded address — and had already fallen back to second place by the time it aired.We rate this claim Half True.HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.",JB Pritzker,"February 25, 2021",half-true
269,Eric Litke,"“On average, 17% of a family’s income goes towards child care in Wisconsin.”","Access to affordable child care is one of many societal shortfalls exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.For low-income parents in particular, quality center-based care can be financially out of reach, leading them to cobble together arrangements with family, friends and home-based options that may not guarantee needed safety and consistency. Even before COVID-19 further limited available options, a 2019 study found center-based child care is unaffordable for 63% of full-time working families.Wisconsin State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski — a Democrat and potential 2022 U.S. Senate candidate — sought to highlight this crisis in a recent tweet.""On average, 17% of a family’s income goes towards child care in Wisconsin,"" Godlewski wrote on Feb. 6, 2021. ""That's ridiculous! Washington must provide financial relief to help struggling families with these ever-rising costs.""Her tweet included a chart showing Wisconsin ranked eighth-worst in the country by that metric according to an analysis by Lending Tree.Godlewski is right that a crisis exists, but she’s a bit off in how she presents the numbers.Let’s take a closer look.Getting the details rightGodlewski cites Lending Tree as her source, which is somewhat less than an authority on the subject. The website is an online loan marketplace that like many other online vendors uses geography-based breakdowns like this to attract website visitors.The group isn’t far off in their analysis, though.Child Care Aware — a national advocacy organization pushing for quality, affordable child care — found the average monthly cost of full-time child care at a child care center is $996 per child in Wisconsin, which is equivalent to 18% of median household income for a family with children under 6.Lending Tree cited a 17% figure for center-based care as a percentage of income using average income. Statisticians typically use median income rather than average to determine rates like this, so outliers such the highest income earners don’t skew the calculation.But there are several key caveats in the Child Care Aware stat (and the similar Lending Tree one) that Godlewski’s wording disregards.The cost is per child, not per family.Featured Fact-checkRobin Vosstated on January 19, 2023 in SpeechIn Wisconsin, even multimillionaires can be on BadgerCare ""because we don't even ask people what their income level is to qualify for free health care.""By Madeline Heim • February 9, 2023The cost refers to full-time, center-based care. Many families use home-based care options or friends and family, or use a combination of those options and center-based care.The percentage comparing child care cost and income is an equivalency, rather than an average as Godlewski frames it.The third point takes a bit more explanation. Imagine two families who each had one child. If one used relatives for child care and had no cost, and the other used full-time, center-based care and paid 34% of their income for that, the two families would average a cost of 17%. That’s the picture painted by Godlewski’s phrasing, that the average cost among families with children is 17%. But that’s incorrect.That figure is only accurate when referring to the group of families that have exactly one child under 6 in child care, with that child attending full-time in a center-based setting. And that’s not a typical child care situation. Only about 24% of children under 6 were in center-based child care full time in 2019, said Sarah Grady, study director of the National Household Education Survey, a federal program administered by the National Center for Education Statistics.In actuality, that stat (18%, according to Child Care Aware) is simply an equivalence. It is stating that the cost of putting one child in a full-time, center-based care is equivalent to 18% of the typical income for a family with children in that age range.We should also note that the cost relative to income predictably changes drastically based on the number of parents and children involved. For example, Child Care Aware says the full-time center-based care option would be equal to 37% of median household income for a single-parent family with one child under 6.How many parents pay for child careGodlewski’s core point is about families paying for child care, so here’s what we know on that point. You can look at this statistic in terms of children or in terms of families.On a per-child basis, about 40% of children 5 and under were in at least one out-of-home child care arrangement that parents paid for nationwide, according to the latest data from the National Household Education Survey. That includes those that pay for just a portion of a week and use any type of paid child care, not just licensed centers.In terms of working families, the Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy research and advocacy organization, estimates 55% of working families pay for some portion of child care. Again, that includes those that pay for just a portion of a week.Predictably, higher-income families are more likely to use licensed child care centers, the Center for American Progress found, again limiting the usefulness of the average family metric Godlewski invoked. Among the 20% of families with the highest income, 66% used licensed child care; but only 33% of families whose income was in the bottom 20%.Our rulingCriticizing the high cost of child care in Wisconsin, Godlewski claimed, ""On average, 17% of a family’s income goes towards child care in Wisconsin.""She’s right that child care costs can be a financially impossible burden for many families. But her stat misses on several points.That figure isn’t an average, it simply compares the price of full-time, center-based child care to the typical family income, expressing that ratio as a percentage. This number only holds true for a family with one child who has that child in full-time center-based care, which is far from a typical situation. Many families use a combination of options, or pay for home-based care. And this phrasing actually drastically understates the cost for a single-parent family or a family with multiple children using center-based care.We define Half True as a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
